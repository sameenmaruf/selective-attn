Mr President, our committee views these issues very differently and, to start, I will speak from the point of view of research.
We see it as a very positive sign that, in her own conclusions, the rapporteur has taken account of our committee 's proposal that the Cohesion Fund countries should broaden the research infrastructure by locating universities and colleges in such a way that they would serve those who live in undeveloped regions better than now and make it easier for educated people to remain in their home districts.
This will be possible with action on the part of governments, and such decentralisation of higher education will be an unquestionably useful policy in evening out development.
Another matter we would like to address, specifically from the point of view of industrial policy, is that we would have liked the Commission to pay more attention to the effects of services, electronic commerce and the growing use of the Internet, when they were planning the coordination of Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds.
Poverty and wealth used to depend more on means of livelihood.
The rich areas were those where there were jobs in industry, but today those areas might have become a burden, and they may well be poor, meaning we also have to invest in new sectors of industry such as electronic production, as I might call it, and the production of services, because they are the industries of the future.
In my opinion the committee drafting the report has not taken sufficient account of this, so on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I would draw the Commission 's attention to this issue.
Finally, as the committee representing energy, we would have liked the issue of support for renewable energy resources from Cohesion and Regional Development funds to have been emphasised still more, thus, through a process of coordination, increasing the use of renewables so that the scant funding resources in the energy programme might have been compensated by means of these more substantial sums.
<d>
Mr President, we - myself included - support the report by Mrs Lienemann, the targets it sets and the directive under discussion.
However, we should look a little more closely at some points.
For example, a major problem in my country is the diversion of rivers and the consumption of water from lakes, which people try to justify by pseudo-developmental arguments, and which, of course, are a great risk to ground waters, water tables and surface waters.
I therefore think that regardless of whether we finally conclude who should decide whether such diversions take place, the specifications common to us all must be very stringent.
But the key issue is, in my opinion, planning how to restore water tables, the natural flow of rivers and the natural content of lakes, which must be carried out within the ten year period we have in mind.
I think such projects ought to be eligible for funding, because, at the end of the day, that restoration may well prove to be a first-rate development policy.
<d>
Mr President, Commissioner, water is a precious natural asset, a vital necessity, and it is our duty to protect it.
I think it essential to have a framework directive on water policy in the European Union, which will be the basic legal instrument for improving the quality and proper management of water resources, and I congratulate the rapporteur on her attempt to address this thorny issue and take due account of all the points of view.
I must say, however, that, there are discrepancies between the countries in the north and south concerning water, and that is why the matter cannot be dealt with in the same way.
There are parts of Europe with an inherent shortage of water, and that should be taken into account by this directive.
In recent years, climate change has compelled Mediterranean countries to face serious problems of flooding or lack of rain.
We agree with the common position but we also accept several of the amendments tabled, whose aim is to improve it.
However, we cannot accept amendments such as those that refer to the issue of costing water, granted that in my country a high proportion of the users are farmers.
In addition, amendments which ban the transfer of water from one hydrological basin to another would condemn many areas in my country to water shortage.
The issue of eliminating hazardous substances ought, I think, to be made more realistic so that we can achieve it.
As for the time scale demanded for the directive 's implementation, it must be borne in mind that there are countries where creating the infrastructure for this directive' s implementation will take time and considerable resources.
In spite of these remarks however, I believe our common objective of sustainable use of water resources can be maintained.
<d>
Mr President, Commissioner, no one could dispute the usefulness of implementing the qualitative and quantitative data on the fishing industry, particularly in view of the reform of the CFP in 2002.
We are also of the opinion that Community funds should be set aside to fund these activities.
A common fisheries policy must coordinate as well as possible the requirements for conservation of species and resource management with economic and market requirements.
To this end, more extensive, compatible, uniform data is required, and we expect this to provide us with more general information on the Union 's fishing industry if properly collected and interpreted.
However, we also expect there to be greater awareness and appreciation of the peculiarities, differences, varying situations and traditions of the fishing industries, and that they will not be disregarded, penalised or even eliminated due to the misinterpretation of the concept of harmonisation of fisheries policies, as has sometimes occurred in the past.
A case in point is the Mediterranean, including my country 's fishing industry.
After years of the CFP for the Mediterranean restricting itself to trade regulations and company aid, Regulation 1626 at last introduced a responsible fisheries policy, with measures protecting vulnerable fishery resources in order to ensure sustainable exploitation.
This is a worthy objective, the implementation of which, however, has sometimes revealed an ignorance of the biological characteristics of Mediterranean species of fish.
A subsequent regulation, Regulation 1448, adopted, not by chance, in 1999, permitted certain exemptions, in particular for special cases.
The time period will elapse on 31 May next, to be precise, when the Commission will present a proposal.
We hope that the presentation of the proposal will take into account the fact that this fishing system is vitally important for the economy of huge Italian coastal areas and that the scientific data hitherto collected demonstrate that, from the point of view of biological implications, resources are, to some extent, sustainable.
<d>
Mr President, in this great debate about human rights it is surprising how infrequently we hear children mentioned - the people who are least able to protect themselves in relation to human rights.
Children are actually invisible in the EU Treaties.
Animals have rights, children do not.
Yet children are affected by the laws that the EU passes and the single market.
The electronic revolution seems to have given more freedom to exploiters, the paedophiles and the pornographers, than to industrialists.
In a twenty-first century where we regard ourselves as civilised there is still a slave trade in which children are bought and sold for sexual exploitation throughout the world.
We have problems in the candidate countries.
We have a scandal at the moment in Latvia which allegedly goes to the very heart of the government.
We have pictures on our TV almost every day of child soldiers fighting in conflicts throughout the world.
And of course, we have familiar tales of child labour.
We have to take tougher action.
We have to bring children up the agenda.
This is not to say that the EU should start to be responsible for children's policy but we could start by ensuring that EU laws are child-proof.
We should ensure that measures developed by the Commission have a specific children's dimension.
We should ensure that there is somebody in the Commission with responsibility for child matters.
In 1998 my own government appointed a child rights expert from Save The Children to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to develop strategies and practical projects in relation to children's rights.
Why can we not do the same?
We also have in Great Britain a Children's Select Committee able to investigate child abuses and to interrogate expert witnesses.
Why can we not do the same?
Can we make sure that the Charter of Fundamental Rights has a section relating to children?
I know we have communications.
We have action plans and conventions but what we want is action, not good intentions.
<d>
Question No 1 by (H-0141 / 00):
Subject: Human rights of women in Europe On 19 January 2000, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe met to prepare a special session of the UN General Assembly due to take place on 5-9 June 2000 in New York to assess the situation of women five years on from the Beijing World Conference on Women, which adopted a platform for action to tackle the problems faced by women at international level.
During the proceedings, the Swiss Foreign Minister, Mrs Ruth Dreifuss, stated that 300 000 women were victims of trafficking in Europe.
Does the Council concur with that statement?
Does it consider that the measures it is taking are sufficient to guarantee the safety and dignity of women in Europe in the face of the threat of trafficking?
What additional measures will it take to counteract a probable deterioration in the situation arising from enlargement, given that the majority of victims are from countries applying for membership of the Union?
<d>
Mr President, for about ten years I have been involved with campaigns to promote education throughout the world.
A hundred and twenty-five million children, mainly girls, do not receive any education.
I am extremely pleased that I am now a Member of the European Parliament and can take specific action and that in this resolution all Groups are saying that the EU development cooperation budget should be doubled.
We are not talking about more money for the development budget but about redistribution within that budget.
According to Commissioner Nielson, we spend 5% on education as a whole and an estimated 80% of that on primary education.
Because I am also rapporteur for the budget for the year 2001, I hope that we as a Parliament, in consultation with Commissioner Nielson - who has, moreover, said that he wants to move in this direction - will be able to double that budget next year.
That would really be a concrete step forward, because so much of the money that we spend simply does not reach the poorest people and is not a step towards real development.
Finally, we cannot develop others, they must develop themselves, but this is a wonderful opportunity to help them and Parliament, together with the Commission, will soon be able to translate this resolution very specifically into real action in the 2001 budget.
<d>
Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur for her handling of what is a very complex matter where both producing and non-producing Member States have serious reservations regarding the Commission proposals.
In very broad terms, I welcome the Commission proposal to bring flax and hemp into the arable area payments scheme.
A single area payment is in line with the view that growers should respond to market demands rather than be driven by CAP subsidies.
However, I shall not repeat the many reservations about the proposals that colleagues have already mentioned.
We should note that flax and hemp are environmentally-friendly crops.
Compared with mainstream crops such as oil seeds and cereals, they require low levels of chemical and fertiliser treatment.
They also produce renewable raw materials that can displace synthetic fibres derived from petroleum and other mineral resources.
We should welcome, therefore, the expansion of industrial crop activity and the opportunities provided for diversification.
However, I wish to raise the question of land eligibility, which appears to be a particular problem in the UK.
Most of the flax and hemp grown in the UK is on land ineligible for arable area payments.
The Commission proposals, as I understand them, threaten the UK growers and would leave UK processors with no domestic supply of raw material.
It has been suggested that the land eligibility rules should be disregarded for flax and hemp so that any land could be used for those crops, but without an increase in the base area.
This would allow expansion, should market conditions encourage growth, and allow new growers to enter the market.
It would be helpful if the Commissioner could comment on this matter when he responds to the debate.
<d>
Mr President, the essentials have been covered, but I should like to reiterate the point that the right to propose legislation rests with the Commission.
We have taken an initiative across the various political groups, which we presented in February to President Prodi.
As a matter of law there has been a reference to political parties in the Treaty for more than seven years now.
It states that the parties are a factor for integration, they contribute to the formation of European awareness and are a vital element in the democratic life of the Union and the political debate of the Union.
However, like several of the rather aspirational articles in the Treaties, Article 191, the article referred to, lacks a certain operational content.
The question is: can the Commission take an initiative which breathes life and operational content into the aspirations of Article 191?
That really is what the debate is about in this House today.
I share the concern of other speakers that the reports of the Court of Auditors - which, by the way, we fully anticipated in this House several years ago with the report of Professor Tsatsos, which pointed out the urgent necessity of validating parties in statutory terms - adds a new urgency.
The institutions must be able to deliver accountability and transparency.
This House does not have the right to draft legislation: that is the exclusive preserve of the Commission.
We are asking for your assistance to ensure that this vital element, as the Treaty states, in the democratic life and political debate of the Union is validated by statute.
<d>
Council.
(FR) There is indeed a project, or rather studies, in progress with regard to the transportation of water from the Rhone to Catalonia, but - for the time being at least - it does not involve the French or Spanish authorities.
What is more, the European Parliament and the Council have put forward a proposal for a directive establishing a framework for a community water policy.
It was adopted recently through a conciliation procedure on 29 June 2000.
It should be noted that this framework directive is primarily aimed at conserving, protecting and improving the quality of the environment, as well as promoting the careful and rational use of natural resources.
It sets out the basic principles for a sustainable water policy in the European Union based on the principles enshrined in the Treaty, for example those relating to precautionary, preventative and corrective action by according priority to the source of the threats to the environment, as well as the polluter-pays principle.
It must be noted that this project should also apply to both surface and ground water with the aim of preventing any further deterioration, promoting the sustainable use of water based on the long-term protection of available water resources and helping to mitigate the effects of floods and droughts.
The project is designed to ensure that these water sources are maintained in good condition through a series of measures that Member States are to implement according to a specific timetable.
On the other hand, it follows that all initiatives of this type must automatically be subject to both a socio-economic and environmental assessment.
<d>
Mr President, our Group, the European United Left / Nordic Green Left, shares many of the considerations and opinions on enlargement contained in Mr Brok 's report and we appreciate the enormous effort he has put into his courageous report.
However, we disagree on some important issues.
Our support for enlargement goes without saying.
We are also in favour of a European Union that includes Russia, and which therefore includes all the countries which have built - albeit in conflicting ways - this historical, cultural, economic, social and political reality known as Europe.
The only condition would be - in our view - that they share our democratic values and respect for human rights and the rule of law.
Our disagreements with a portion of Mr Brok 's report range from points of detail to others of greater importance.
We do not agree with Recital A where it says that Europe was divided by the Soviet occupation because, as everybody knows and as any history book will tell you, the division was a consequence of the Yalta Conference and the intransigence of Truman who was determined to follow a policy of confrontation.
Furthermore, there are six basic aspects which worry us because of the method employed.
Firstly, we are against the 'regatta principle', which seems more like an entrance examination which every teacher puts their pupil through when it would have been better for the pupil to sit the exam in stages and to a previously established timetable, which would have aided the rapprochement of the two societies, thereby preventing the adverse consequences we are now seeing.
Secondly, given the reality that the neo-liberal economic model established in Maastricht leads to the paradox of growth with more inequalities, the most likely outcome of the incorporation of these countries is greater unemployment and inequality, as is already happening.
We should change our economic model in advance so that the cost of enlargement is not even more serious social inequality.
Thirdly, the great differences between European agriculture and that of the majority of the candidate countries mean that the current common agricultural policy should have been improved in order to ensure both the viability of our agriculture and the successful completion of the agricultural reforms in those countries.
Nevertheless, everything is moving in the opposite direction owing, amongst other things, to the World Trade Organisation, which complicates everything.
Fourthly, and in relation to the use of FEDER funds, we believe that there should be more effort to show solidarity, and that is not happening, and the forecasts therefore seem to us be insufficient.
Fifthly, we also feel that the budgetary forecasts are not sufficient, since this is the first time that a major enlargement is taking place with a budgetary reduction and we only have to look at what happened in the case of the reunification of Germany to see that, in fact, a greater economic contribution is needed in order for this process to be successful.
Sixthly, we believe it has been a mistake to link enlargement in practice with the prior integration of these countries into NATO.
This damages the Union, its future independence in relation to the United States and also a common European defence and security policy, since it also introduces risks with regard to Russia and other countries.
We are therefore in favour of some aspects but not of others.
<d>
Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his introduction but I am still left with a few questions.
You said that you have a total shake-up of the framework programme in mind.
We have tried to do this with the fifth framework programme and, as it now transpires, with very little effect.
In a resolution quoted by yourself, which was adopted in this Parliament on 18 May and for which I was rapporteur, I recommended multi-disciplinary teams for research, since innovations often occur on the cutting edge of different disciplines.
I cannot find any reference to this in your report which I have now read and which you adopted this week.
My second point, Commissioner, is that you recommend the European Union to take part in national programmes.
I have also written that, in Europe, we need to move away from techno-nationalism, but once again if the framework programme is what we are concerned with, this Parliament - and I repeat this very Parliament - plays a crucial role, and how will Parliament 's role take shape if we apply variable geometry?
<d>
Mr President, I just want to point out that FYROM is rather an anachronism and I invite our Greek colleagues, who always do their duty when Macedonia is on the agenda, to intervene perhaps a little more firmly with their government and supersede this situation, which frankly borders on the ridiculous.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think this resolution is important because it refers to a positive decision by the Macedonian government, and unfortunately not by all the political forces of Macedonia, on the law on higher education which will at last allow young people from minorities, in particular the Albanian minority, to study in their mother tongue.
I think we should congratulate Mr Georgievsky, the Prime Minister, and Mr Xhaferi, leader of the Albanian party in the government majority, who are behind this law on higher education. Unfortunately, it was not supported by the parliamentary opposition.
It is regrettable that, at the request of the Socialist Group in particular, the text of the resolution does not mention their names, and I would like to point out to our Socialist friends that their request, made in the name of a more general principle that political forces should not be cited, strikes me as rather unreliable given that, looking at the motion for a resolution on the Middle East we are going to vote on today, we are frankly dealing with very specific situations and very specific players.
So, once again, we have double standards and I think that is deplorable.
I call on the Commission to monitor this issue very closely.
It will take a great deal of money to establish the university.
This is a practical way of supporting a project which could help overcome the problems of two large, differing populations living side by side, and this is an area where monitoring by the Commission is crucial.
<d>
This question makes me smile a little.
In my opinion, ambassadors are quite simply there to represent the government of their country.
They must, of course, pass local information back to their government, but the question here was to find a solution to a situation where fourteen Member States had taken measures with regard to the fifteenth for the political reasons that are familiar to you.
I therefore think it was quite appropriate, in this context, to ask an external authority, that was not morally implicated, to undertake this task.
I think Austria has no call for complaint regarding what has been done, quite the contrary.
I would add that if any individual country had followed up on their ambassador 's report, then perhaps the solutions advocated by the experts' report would not have been applied.
<d>
The Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities is voting against Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado 's report on enhanced cooperation.
The report proposes abolishing the right of veto, which would in reality mean that countries which are very keen on further integration could forge ahead without having broad democratic support.
The ulterior motive is to be able to continue the development towards' ever closer union 'without being hampered by the enlargement to which the EU countries have committed themselves.
Enhanced cooperation would cause most policies, including the most sensitive ones, to be centralised to a still greater degree than they are already.
In this way, Mr Gil-Robles proposes discontinuing the common foreign and security policy.
We consider, however, that future development will increase the need for far more varied and flexible cooperation in Europe.
To allow decisions on ever more important topics to be made on the basis of qualified majority voting would be in conflict with basic democratic standards.
Countries with a tradition of holding referendums before surrendering sovereignty may in future be in danger of finding themselves in a situation in which a proposal that is rejected nationally is adopted at EU level.
Those countries which are not so keen on integration are left with a poor alternative, namely that of copying the legislation without having any real say in it.
What they cannot do, however, is avoid the pioneer countries' legislation.
The Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities wants a freer and more flexible Europe in which there is no pressure to be involved in everything.
We want to see a Europe of democracies and diversity.
We are therefore voting against the report.
<d>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the right to become acquainted with the contents of the documents of the European Union 's institutions is a precondition of the public' s ability to monitor decision-making generally and influence it.
At present, we are creating an open and modern-style administration, in which it is natural that the public should have this direct right.
Obviously there have to be limits to such a right, and that is something we are also discussing today.
At the moment in the European Union there already exists the practice of public access to documentation, and we should remember that brave citizens and many progressive Member States have been fighting for increased transparency for many years.
We are not exactly starting this discussion from scratch: we can consider it our duty to see to it that transparency is increased and the criteria of the Treaty of Amsterdam are met.
The report we are now examining in many respects takes the situation in a better direction.
It is excellent that the report should state that public access to documents and the obligation to release documents affect all the institutions, and not just the three main ones.
It is also excellent that the institutions should be obliged, or they should be allowed, rather, to release documents also to those not resident in the European Union, or who are not citizens of the European Union.
This principle should be strengthened further. Ladies and gentlemen, you can no doubt imagine that one day an EU citizen will need information, for example, on what the administration in the United States of America is doing.
In fact, there is no reason for restricting public access geographically.
However, the report does not sufficiently explain how possible separate provisions, which would remain in force at the same time as this regulation, would meet the criteria of greater transparency.
This is a vague area, and it is possible that more restrictive provisions may also remain in force, and this is one point in respect of which we have tabled amendments.
As regards the definition of documents, this is a crucial question, and we could surely argue about just that for a whole year, which is probably what has happened.
It is essential that scope for practising some degree of internal thought process should be allowed for the institutions, but we have to be very careful here, as we might create a situation in which documents drafted to prepare a decision may be excluded from the principle of transparency, and obviously decision-making cannot then be influenced.
In my opinion, the report also goes too far in its recognition of the rights of so-called third parties to restrict the availability of documents.
It may be the job of the Council and the Commission to uphold such restrictions, but I think it is not in the interests of Parliament or the public.
The list of exceptions, as Mrs Maij-Weggen said, is essential, and perhaps the most important part of this work.
That aspect of the matter has made substantial progress, but I would like to focus special attention on the fact that if we want our citizens to be able to follow general developments in security policy in the future, I repeat, general, an exception regarding defence, security and military matters is much too broad in scope.
It should be defined more precisely or a harm test should be attached to it.
Mr President, the right of Members of Parliament to confidential documents is a very important issue, but it cannot replace the direct right of access to information on the part of the public.
Parliament still needs to work on this report more, and for that reason I believe that it must be improved upon still here.
<d>
Mr President, throughout their various interventions, MEPs have concentrated on two quite different points: in the first place, the problem of climate change and, in the second place, what the Commission or the European Union can do in a situation like the present one, with the extremely serious floods that have occurred.
With regard to the first subject, I should like to point out that, as Parliament also does, we attach great importance to the problem of climate change and to the conference that is at this moment taking place in The Hague.
We actively participated in the preparations for the conference and insisted that the European Union must assume a leading role in it.
We agree with a number of assertions already made to the effect that we are in this way contributing to the protection of the environment and to the credibility of the environmental protocols with a view to their ratification in 2002.
We are aware that the global destabilisation of the climate caused by the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will be the most important challenge for Europe 's energy sector.
The energy and transport sectors produce 85% of the total emissions of greenhouse gases in the European Union.
It is therefore these industries which ought to be making a major effort to reduce emissions.
Given its anticipated continuous growth - of more than 38% in the next decade - the transport sector will be that which requires the more important measures.
On this basis, the Commission is shortly going to be proposing two strategic documents: a combination of policies and measures designed to provide a response to the Kyoto commitments and to the objectives regarding transport and energy.
The first will deal with the security of the energy supply and the second with a revised common transport policy.
Apart from environmental problems, however, I should also like to comment on what we are able to do at the moment.
As you know, we have a basic difficulty: the legal basis for taking action.
You know that, historically, there was a budget heading dedicated to emergency aid for populations in exceptional situations.
This heading disappeared from the Budget some time ago on the basis of the argument that these were matters to which the subsidiarity principle applied and which ought to be raised at national, rather than Community, level.
Ever since then, the Commission 's margin for manoeuvre has been very limited.
The Commission has taken two initiatives along these lines.
One of these is very clear and is connected with civil protection: on 27 September 2000, we presented a draft Council decision for reinforcing Community instruments designed to coordinate the various systems of civil protection at European level.
This will be effective in helping us solve problems, but it is not going to solve problems such as those we are creating now.
All that we shall have left are the financing instruments that already exist.
Mrs Ghilardotti raised the possibility of seeking funds.
It is not so easy to do that.
As you know better than anyone, funds are fully allocated and there are no generalised fund surpluses, even though there may be specific instances where there are no budgetary implementations.
What is certain is that, if there is no legal basis for using these funds, it is very difficult to obtain them.
The Commission 's proposal, which Commissioner Wallström explained in detail in this Parliament, is therefore to use the currently existing EAGGF funds, or the structural funds of the Interreg funds.
The fact is that, in these cases, we cannot speak of actions of the Commission involving a global programme. Either we totally change the model or we shall have to think of the actions concerned as being at the request of the Member States and involving programmes or specific actions dependent upon the use of these funds.
As we said just now, we are entirely sympathetic to these practical projects, and I want to insist upon this point today, but it is absolutely essential to be able to rely on these proposals if we are to be able to take action.
With regard, finally, to the possibility of using Article 87.2, established in the Treaty, as a basis for Community aid, I believe that this involves an extravagant interpretation of this article, and that is leaving aside the budgetary problems it would create.
The article does not relate to Community aid, but relates to the compatibility of national aid with Community legislation.
What this article says is that, in the case of natural catastrophes, national aid may be compatible.
Each time the Commission has proposed the compatibility of such national aid following natural catastrophes, there has always been such compatibility.
We are therefore entirely sympathetic to acting right now within the legal and budgetary margins available to us.
<d>
Mr President, 11 out of the 15 EU countries recognise the right of resale. However, it is in force only in eight countries, and this is with varying degrees of success.
The right of resale is not recognised in the legislation of Austria, the Netherlands, Ireland and the United Kingdom. Outside the European Union, neither Switzerland nor the United States recognise the right of resale.
At first sight, establishing a legislative text concerning the right of resale would seem to be justified by a desire for equity and in order to benefit creative artists.
In fact, the resale right does not benefit artists, quite the contrary: it hinders the market which should be dynamic and be able to grow with a minimum of restrictions.
Consumer dynamics and sales potential are matters of concern to living artists who discern an increase in their market value and reassessment of their work.
The resale right gives rise to complicated court cases, which are truly costly compared with the often modest sums involved, which generally do not reach the beneficiary.
It entails additional administrative tasks, which serve to fuel criticism of European standards.
It penalises the efforts of galleries who should be focussing on helping artists.
It gives rise to fear, creates extra costs and administrative hassles for well-meaning potential buyers. And on occasion, it can lead to absurd situations: given that the right of resale is calculated on the basis of the resale price, in the event of depreciation transferring a work of art is more lucrative than actually creating one.
Is it therefore necessary to extend this legislative text to the countries who do not want it - I am referring here to the United Kingdom which is currently at the top of the European art market - if to do so would be to threaten their competitiveness?
<d>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, on 25 December - Christmas Day - of last year, three prominent Albanian Kosovars started a three-week hunger strike in Brussels to bring to the attention of the international community the fate of these prisoners and especially of the many thousands of missing persons.
In mid-January of this year, a few thousand Kosovars held a demonstration in front of the Brussels Council building and a delegation was received by the services of Mr Solana and the Portuguese Presidency.
We were told that Mr Solana was understanding of these demands but it was also pointed out that - and I quote - the fact of the matter is that it is difficult to do business with a regime such as that of Milosevic.
Ladies and gentlemen, Milosevic has now been replaced by Kostunica and I was in Kosovo when Kostunica received a very warm welcome at the Biarritz Summit, and was given several millions of EURO aid unconditionally.
However, what has Kostunica done about the problem of prisoners in the meantime?
It is true that by way of a symbolic gesture, one of the prisoners, Mrs Flora Brovina has been freed, but that cannot be the end of it, ladies and gentlemen.
Our compromise resolution is clearly stipulated in Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3.
We demand a swift release of the political prisoners and an impartial inquiry into the whereabouts of the missing persons.
Mr Solana, Mr Patten, I ask you both to put the Kostunica regime sufficiently under pressure to ensure these demands are met.
I would like to say the following to Mr Kostunica: you would gain in credibility if you were to take advantage of the forthcoming Christmas celebrations to carry out such an act of goodwill, which can only benefit stability in the region.
<d>
Mr President, I believe that the great merit of these reports is that they tone down the optimism of the Commission 's communication regarding what it calls the progress made since Barcelona, and that they open the way to ambitious and fairer paths for the partnership to take.
What were the objectives of that partnership? They are, once again, the creation of an area of peace, the improvement of mutual understanding amongst the peoples of the region and the creation of an area of shared prosperity.
The first two goals have not been achieved, as Mr Naïr has said.
Unfortunately, this is true.
We have not created an area of shared prosperity either, only the very beginnings of a free-trade area involving some of the countries, established on European terms, because the main beneficiaries of these are the industrial products in which we have a competitive advantage.
I am continually surprised, moreover, that those who are the quickest to call for an extension of a free-trade area, imposing the liberal model on terms that are extremely unfavourable for the countries of the South, are also the first to speak of interference, even neo-colonialism, with regard to human rights issues.
In Barcelona, the vital contribution of civil society to the development of partnerships was recognised for the first time in a text to which the European Union and 15 countries of the southern Mediterranean subscribed.
We must admit that we have failed spectacularly on this issue.
We have been unable to support the dynamic efforts of citizens and democratic projects, in the face of the hard line adopted by most governments, but is this from lack of any real will to do so?
How can we use the association agreements and the MEDA programme to support them?
What sort of effective strategy and what set of relevant measures can we create in order to avoid this schizoid situation where what we say and what we do are two quite different things?
Do we really wish to reinvigorate the Barcelona Process, or would we rather condemn ourselves to the Europe of the Fifteen 's continuing to pursue relations in the same traditional mould as some self-styled' realistic 'states?
<d>
I have just voted in favour of the Amending Budget 1 / 2001 of the European Union for the 2001 financial year, which provides for an extra EUR 971 million to cope with the consequences of the BSE crisis.
I would like to stress, however, that this figure had been calculated by the Commission in January and it already appears to have been completely overtaken by events.
Since last Monday, we have found ourselves faced with a paradox, where the European Union cannot, or does not want to, provide French farmers with extra funding and is leaving France to cope in total isolation by allowing it to provide exceptional national aid.
At a time, then, when the crisis is hitting hard and when European solidarity is needed most, the European Union is falling unceremoniously by the wayside.
I am admittedly the first to say that the overall European budget should not be increased as it already costs us a fair amount of money and that we must adhere to the 2000-2006 Financial Perspective approved by the Berlin Council in 1999. Even so, this does not mean, however, that nothing can be done.
For the time being, the Financial Perspective still leaves us with a margin of EUR 506 million for 2001 under the headings for agriculture. In the short and medium term, there is no reason to leave this sum sitting there, even if the allocated funding for agriculture has all been spent.
Instead of increasing the European Union 's total budget, there is another possibility, which is to transfer the expenditure under the Structural Funds heading to the agricultural section of the budget. In recent years, this expenditure has never been totally exhausted and, in any case, it is not always spent on such urgent needs (excluding funding to the applicant countries, of course).
Moreover, this would not constitute misappropriation as, first and foremost, the aim of the Structural Funds is to support activity throughout the whole Union, and this would be the case if the funds were helping to combat the devastating consequences of BSE.
The problems that we are experiencing would justify this unusual step.
It is becoming obvious to us all that, over the longer term, Europe 's agricultural policy, which may have had the distinction of helping to develop our agricultural industry in the 1960s, is now having adverse effects - handouts, bureaucracy, price inflation and intensification, which poses a health risk - to such an extent that far-reaching reform is inevitable.
We have said for years that we must put in place much stricter rules than we have today to promote respect for nature and health, without increasing the burden on taxpayers.
Logically speaking, the consumer should pay the difference by buying products at their actual price, or at a price that is closer to reality.
In the same way, if we want to maintain our independence in the food sector, imports will of course, on the one hand, have to be subject to the same safety rules and, on the other, will, in certain cases, have to be subject to taxes to allow production to be continued in European countries.

In the end I voted against the Schwaiger report despite its good qualities, because the debate we held yesterday, and in particular Commissioner Lamy's replies to my three questions, left me very dissatisfied.
In reply to my first question - and is it not dangerous to negotiate the Built-In Agenda separately? - Commissioner Lamy said that the ongoing negotiations in Geneva on agricultural trade and trade in services are not really negotiations but just preparatory talks.
Perhaps that distinction is valid from an abstract point of view, but in practice I do not think it holds water.
The Commission's reply to my second question - should we not redefine the negotiating mandate in the light of the trend of events and public opinion? - was negative: it stated that the Commission would stick to the mandate defined at the time of Agenda 2000.
In any case, the European Parliament has just underpinned that position by explicitly rejecting two amendments calling for the Blair House Agreement to be renegotiated.
In his reply to my third question - before opening new negotiations, should we not first define more clearly how the negotiators are to be monitored? - Commissioner Lamy referred mainly to the framework agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission.
That is certainly a matter of some significance, but basically my question concerned scrutiny by the Council, which sets the Commission's negotiating objectives, and by the national parliaments, which in my view have the final say.
Confusion continues to prevail with regard to these aspects.
I very much regret that the Protocol, which was still part of the preliminary draft for Nice in November, was not incorporated, at least the part concerning scrutiny of the way negotiations are conducted at the WTO.
It stated that the Presidency and the Member States may accompany the Commission to WTO meetings, that the Commission must forward all the documents at its disposal without delay, that it has a binding obligation to respond to the wishes of a Member State to open a consultation procedure, that the common position upheld by the Commission is established by the Council, and that the Council may at all times address negotiating directives to the Commission.
I believe it is essential to observe these rules, in one form or another, in order to ensure proper scrutiny of the WTO negotiations.

Mr President, as many fellow Members have already stated, I believe that the biotechnology industry can bring about improvements, particularly in medicine, but I think that it would be naïve to believe that it can solve all the world 's problems.
When I hear what some Members have to say, or when I read certain passages in the report, I am stunned and astounded.
World hunger, unexpected climate change, protection of the environment, all these problems could be resolved tomorrow thanks to the benefits of biotechnology.
I think that it would be just as naïve to simply disregard the possible risks, excesses and abuses, all the more so because we are already seeing some of them taking place.
The risks and excesses could either be curbed or increased depending on developments in legislation both in the European Union and internationally.
I would like to make just two points. The first relates to drug patenting.
We are now seeing the problems of access to generic drugs to combat AIDS in the African nations, Brazil and countries in Asia.
Given the pharmaceutical industry 's propensity for the use of biotechnology in future drugs, I think that this problem will only grow worse and that we will therefore have to ensure that patent legislation does not prevent production and parallel imports of generic drugs to combat great scourges and serious diseases, which threaten the poorest nations.
My second point relates to patents on genetic discoveries.
I think that a clear distinction must certainly be made between patents on inventions and patents on discoveries, especially since biological riches are concentrated in the countries of the South, in tropical areas, because, otherwise, we will once again see the countries of the South being plundered so that major laboratories of industrialised nations can benefit.
In any case, we must put an end to the 'patenting of life forms'.
The third point, which will bring me to my conclusion, is that I believe fundamental decisions, particularly on releasing GMOs, must continue to come under political responsibility.
The European Food Safety Authority will most probably play a crucial role in providing expertise, information and recommendations, but it is the competent authorities which must, on a political level, continue to authorise the release of GMOs.
As long as problems such as traceability, labelling and determining responsibility for damage persist and as long as we have no guarantees on risks, I believe that we are justified in continuing the moratorium.

Mr President, I wanted to ask who is representing the Swedish Presidency here today for this important debate.
Can you give me a name?
Yesterday, the State Secretary responsible, Mr Malmberg, informed me that to his great regret he cannot be with us today.
I regret this all the more as there will probably be a debate about Sweden's national budget, and he will not be with us here.
Could you please tell us who is representing the Swedish Presidency in today's debate at political level?
Thank you.

Mr President, Members of Parliament, the Commission welcomes Parliament's proposed resolution and supports the objectives of these two Swedish initiatives establishing a system of special forensic profiling analysis of synthetic drugs and on the transmission of samples of illegal narcotic substances.
The Commission has been working in this area for some time.
In particular it has supported research into the development of a harmonised method for the profiling of amphetamines.
This research project is due to be completed in February 2002 and we hope that its results will be taken into account in future work in this area.
The objective of the Swedish initiatives is in line with point 4.1.1.4 of the European Union action plan on drugs 2000-2004 which was endorsed at the Feira European Council of June 2000 and so represents a priority for the European Union in the fight against drugs.
The Commission is also working actively on the implementation of the EU action plan on drugs.
In the coming weeks, we intend to publish two important texts: first, the Commission will present a communication to Parliament and to the Council on the implementation of the action plan, and secondly the Commission will bring forward proposals for a framework decision establishing minimum rules on drug trafficking.
The issue of synthetic drugs, as mentioned by several Members, is of particular importance at the moment, both for the European Union and internationally.
The Commission intends to launch this year a review of the joint action on new synthetic drugs of June 1997, which allows new synthetic drugs to be controlled throughout the European Union and to be made subject to criminal penalties.
The Commission recently brought forward proposals to monitor informally the non-controlled chemical precursors of synthetic drugs and this is currently being considered by the Council and Parliament.
We have also presented a resolution to the Commission on narcotic drugs in March 2001 addressing the problem of the diversion of precursors for synthetic drugs and this proposal attracted wide support.
We have also been active in a meeting in December 2000 on synthetic drugs organised by Japan within the G8 framework.
All these elements show how important this debate is at world scale.
Therefore, I would like to congratulate Mrs Cederschiöld for her excellent report and join her in my appeal to pass over what I consider minor difficulties in order to have a quick approval of these two Swedish initiatives by the Council.
<d>
Mr President, I fully support legislation to upgrade the quality and standard of telecommunication infrastructures within the European Union.
The changing nature of work today entails a knowledge of, and access to, new modern telecommunication facilities.
However, any changes to our telecommunication infrastructures must be fair and balanced.
It is imperative that new entrants to the marketplace are not permitted to cherrypick the larger and more lucrative urban areas for the use of these important new technologies.
There must be a strong commitment by all governments to ensure that equivalent telecommunications are provided in both urban and particularly rural areas.
This commitment to universal access for urban and rural areas must be intrinsically included in policies pursued by various telecom regulators operating in the marketplace.
New technology can contribute enormously to the implementation of effective rural development policy, and it will be a key factor in the creation of vital new employment in rural areas and in addressing the problem of the urban / rural imbalance which is a priority issue for this Parliament.
I welcome in particular the work of European Commissioner for Consumer Protection, David Byrne, in devising new mechanisms to govern consumer protection rights for people who enter into contracts over the Internet.
Electronic business is now one of the more significant drivers of both successful business development and national economic development.
It provides a fundamental new way of conducting commercial transactions and has far-reaching economic and social implications.
<d>
Mr President, the motion before us will sink our work without trace.
Thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Schleicher, we had a full debate in committee and now we want to report on it to the European Parliament.
My group is holding a special meeting right now but I feel this debate is so important that I wished to attend in person.
We need this debate now so that the Swedish Presidency can bring this matter to a close.
Because if we do not debate it now, this party statute, this regulation will not come to fruition under the Swedish Presidency.
That is why I ask all the honourable Members to show willing and debate this today so that we can vote on it accordingly tomorrow, when the time comes.
So I am most decidedly against this motion.
I am also sorry to have to say as much to my friend and colleague Mr Dupuis.
May I ask you in a spirit of friendship, Mr Dupuis, perhaps to reconsider.
<d>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission shares Parliament's horror and revulsion at the incidents in Trebinje and Banja Luka.
My colleague Chris Patten, who is responsible for this area of work, is visiting Bosnia this afternoon.
He has issued a statement condemning the violence and demanding that the Republika Srpska authorities find those responsible and make sure they face justice.
As regards the Croats' 'self-rule' within the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Commission fully supports the High Representative's decision to remove Mr Jelavic from his position as a member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina and his appeal to the Bosnian Croats to support the development of a stable multi-ethnic state.
Let me make one thing quite clear: the recent incidents do not further the integration of Bosnia and Herzegovina into European structures in any way; nor do they enhance the country's international reputation, especially among donors.
On the contrary, the incidents make it even more difficult to attract the funds which Bosnia so urgently needs, and on which it continues to depend.
The European Union will not withdraw from Bosnia and Herzegovina.
We will continue our efforts to promote the reconstruction of the country and support the many citizens who yearn to live a life in peace.
However, the country's internal problems cannot be resolved merely by concluding a Stabilisation and Association Agreement or offering the prospect of closer relations with the European Union.
Instead, a key prerequisite for the integration of Bosnia and Herzegovina into the European Union is that the country itself undergoes a profound transformation at domestic level and that in doing so, it respects the fundamental values, such as human and minority rights, on which the European Union is founded.
This transformation process is indispensable if integration into the EU is to bring additional benefits in terms of stability, security and economic development.
In the European Union's view, the progress achieved by Bosnia and Herzegovina in the stabilisation and association process are the test of the country's willingness to complete this transformation.
Above all, we expect progress in implementing the specific measures agreed a year ago as part of the 'Road Map', which include refugee return.
Of the 18 measures in total, just 5 have been fully implemented so far.
A further 9 have been partially implemented, while 4 have still not been addressed at all.
Yet the next phase of the process, that is, the feasibility study, cannot begin until all the measures have been implemented.
As part of the CARDS programme, the Commission will continue to focus its assistance on target groups which promote refugee return and the reconciliation process.
Out of a total of EUR 105.3 million in funding for Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2001, EUR 37.3 million - by far the largest individual amount - will be used to support refugee return.
Of this figure, around 16 million are earmarked for the fostering of integration, reconciliation and institution-building, which includes strengthening the constitutional court and three human rights bodies.
In line with the calls voiced here by the honourable Members, the assistance provided within the CARDS framework is linked to conditions.
As there have been more obstacles to refugee return in the Republika Srpska than in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Republika Srpska has received less funding in this area.
When deciding on the restructuring or cancellation of assistance, it must be borne in mind that the CARDS programme provides support for major structural projects - such as refugee return, human rights, judicial reform, and the development of an independent media - which are a priority for the EU.
Abandoning these projects would merely give fresh impetus to the extremists in Bosnia, who are also hostile to projects of this kind.
In contrast to CARDS, the Commission's reciprocal macrofinancial assistance is not linked to specific conditions.
The assistance is provided as part of a coherent macroeconomic package which was agreed by the authorities in the region and is supported by the international financial institutions.
Due to the specific conditions in Bosnia and Herzegovina, however, the Commission tries to ensure that the overall political environment, that is, the political reality on the ground, is as favourable as possible and that the macroeconomic assistance ties in with other measures taken by the Community.
<d>
Mr President, there are two key reasons for action in this field.
Firstly, we are mutually dependent on each other for the safety of our food and drink.
Food is a single market and food safety is a public health issue.
Each country cannot send its food and farming police to sample the corn, chew the cattle and spot-check the vines in every other country.
We rely on common standards upheld by consistent levels of inspection, assessment and enforcement.
Secondly, the public has lost confidence in the old national and European food safety systems; after the scandals and scares about olive oil, wine, mineral water, beef, eggs, poultry, milk, e-coli, listeria, salmonella, dioxins, hormones and GM foods - and the list goes on.
The public wants to be reassured that the long road from seed or stable to market, supermarket, processing plant, oven, fridge and table is as safe as can reasonably be expected.
They want safety assessment that is neither conducted behind the closed doors of the Commission nor tainted by producer or pressure group interest.
So just as when my report, at the White Paper stage, demanded a system based on science and focused on safety, again we say right across this House: keep the food safety authority slim, transparent, independent and dedicated to assessment of food safety risk and to recommendations as to what action, if any, should be taken.
Do not roam down the lanes of healthy eating or comparative diets, however important in health promotion work such routes may be.
Keep the word safety in the title of the authority to give a clear signal as to its purpose and methodology.
Be, and be seen to be, independent of any one Member State and of the Commission, so do not have a board that allows each country to have a place on it.
Keep the number to 12.
Do not place the EFSA in any building or venue that has close connections with the institutions of the European Union.
Appoint the director of the board after open competition and a parliamentary hearing.
Account to Parliament annually for the stewardship of the remit.
Publish without delay the conclusions and any minority conclusions of the board on any assessed risk, and hold meetings of the board in public.
Attach the food safety bodies of Member States to the authority through an advisory committee comprising the national directors of such bodies.
I commend this report and I commend the rapporteur for a job well done, not least because of the inter-party and inter-country cooperation and discussion throughout.
As a result the amendments in committee, which will in due course be largely subsumed in composite form, can nearly all be supported.
To the Commission and the Council I would say: note the strength of unity in this Parliament on these key issues; cooperate with us in partnership and the beneficiaries will be the European consumers in every Member State.
<d>
Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Hautala for a good piece of work.
If it had only depended upon herself, the result could certainly have been still better, but we have to be able to live with compromises, and these are important steps that are now being taken to move closer to equality in Europe.
The right to equal conditions at the workplace is a fundamental right and should go without saying.
That is unfortunately not the case.
The issue is one of human dignity and of avoiding harassment, something with which everyone ought to agree.
In spite of this, we know that many women in Europe are at present exposed to sexual harassment on a daily basis.
A genuine change in attitude is needed, but also clear and vigorous legislation if we are to create equal opportunities in working life.
The present values also lead to large discrepancies in salaries between men and women.
I nonetheless think it is important to say that equal opportunities for men and women are not in actual fact only a women 's issue. It is an issue that affects us all, irrespective of our gender.
Rights are needed which make it possible for both mothers and fathers to combine professional and family life.
Maternity and paternity leave must obviously be brought into line with each other.
My own experience teaches that equality must begin in the home.
I sometimes think that the Committee on Women 's Rights and Equal Opportunities does not do enough to include us men in its view of equality.
I think that that is a pity and is in danger of delaying more resolute work for equality within the European Union.
I should like to conclude by saying that I feel dissatisfied with Amendment 7.
I do not think that the wording goes far enough.
Every mother and father must be entitled to return to her or his own work after parental leave. I emphasise his or her own work.
The wording, work of equal value is not enough, for there is then a risk of employers less conscious of their responsibilities exploiting this opportunity to create worse conditions for parental leave.
Unfortunately, there are many such examples in my own country, too.
I should therefore have liked to have seen clearer wording.
Allow me an additional ten seconds - given that Mrs Lulling was given an extra two minutes - and allow me to say to the latter that my marriage would never have survived if my wife and I had not shared the parental leave equally.
In view of the fact that Mrs Lulling spoke so clearly, all of us in this House understand that Amendment 17 will of course be supported by Mrs Lulling, and for that I am very grateful.
Thank you.
<d>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms, I would also like to congratulate the general rapporteur, Mr Costa Neves.
I also want to offer congratulations and thanks to all my colleagues on the Committee on Budgets.
It is a rare privilege - and I can measure its worth as a committee rapporteur - to be able to say that the Committee on Budgets accepted all the demands we had made, they were, of course, legitimate and carefully considered, and which were put forward in Parliament at second reading.
So I want to thank the general rapporteur and all the members of the Committee on Budgets.
That said, I would like to address the Council more directly, address the intelligence of the Council, if I dare put it that way, knowing that Mr Vande Lanotte is bound to understand what I mean.
Four years ago, the European Parliament proposed setting up a European fund for refugees, an idea that the Council angrily struck off the list at second reading.
No European refugee fund.
Four years have passed and now the Council has just proposed more money than we ourselves had even asked for the European refugee fund it had refused to create.
It took the Council all of four years to understand, to become responsible and, with respect, to show some intelligence.
Another example: for several years now we have included a Schengen list at the budget 's first reading, because for several years we have wanted some of its aspects to be communitised and financed from the Community budget.
Each year the Council would angrily strike off the Schengen heading at second reading.
This time, the Council needs the Schengen heading we had introduced because it has to finance SIS II and has decided to finance it on a Community basis.
That brings me to the third problem.
We decided - Parliament did so at first reading and will do so at second reading - to vote to enter EUR 5 million under the Europol heading to combat terrorism.
The Council did not accept this at second reading.
I would ask the President-in-Office of the Council to do the impossible and to create the necessary legal basis and agreements.
I would ask it to use this money without waiting four years, because the terrorists for their part will not wait that long.
<d>
Mr President, I should like, first, to congratulate Mrs Thorning-Schmidt, because she has dealt with what is, both technically and politically, a very difficult issue.
Just how difficult this issue is can be seen from the fact that the amended proposal has been pending before the Council since 1994 and the first part of the proposal on mechanical vibration is only now ready for discussion by the joint legislators.
We put health and safety at the top of the social agenda and we have undertaken to improve protection for workers' health and safety by bringing the directive which already exists - 86 / 188 - into line with Framework Directive 89 / 391 and updating some of its provisions.
I should like to point out that some of the proposals we have heard take us behind the current framework and the specific directive which already exists.
Loss of hearing is clearly the most widely-known harmful effect of noise. It is the most serious, but not the only effect.
And as far as compensation for workers who have suffered the consequences of occupational illnesses are concerned, one-third concerns hearing problems.
In five countries in which studies have been carried out - Holland, Portugal, Spain, France and Germany - compensation for hearing problems costs EUR 96 billion a year.
The Commission has accepted the Council's common position in that it enhances the level of protection set out in the Commission proposal.
The reduction in the exposure limit value from 96 db to 87 db is clearly good progress.
The Commission fully accepts Amendments Nos 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 17, 18, 20 and 22, which improve the quality of the text and clarify its meaning.
The Commission partly accepts Amendments Nos 4, 15, 16 and 19 and rejects Amendments Nos 3, 5, 13 and 21, together with Amendments Nos 23 and 25.
Although I agree with the idea behind Amendment No 3, the second part of Amendment No 4, Amendment No 5, Amendment No 13 and the second part of Amendment No 16, the Commission cannot accept them for reasons of consistency and legislative procedure.
The Commission also rejects Amendment No 21, because it feels that the manner in which the Member States obtain access to the relevant medical and scientific advice is a question of subsidiarity.
Finally on the question of compromise Amendments Nos 23 and 25, which temporarily exclude music and entertainment from the scope of the proposal, the Commission is strongly opposed to this derogation because there is no scientific justification for it.
Applying health and safety measures to the music market will affect 3 to 5 million workers in Europe.
Factory noise has been compared with the noise from music or concerts. I think the figures speak for themselves.
Musicians constantly performing in concert are continually exposed to noise levels as high as 130 db.
Constant exposure to this noise gradually gives them problems with their hearing, without which they cannot do their job.
I should also like to remind the House that HINDREC, the European Association of Industry, Hotels and Restaurants, agrees with the proposal currently on the table.
And there is another statistic I should like to give you: the noise level in small pubs is in the order of 75 db, that is, well below the limit value of 90 already set.
Finally to ear protection available on the market. If you surf the Internet you will see all these new aids, which are very different from standard ear muffs.
Basically what they do is to reduce the sound to which each worker is exposed to a level set by the worker, so that they can do their job without suffering this gradual deterioration in their hearing.
Finally, I should like to remind the House that there are another two physical agents in the workplace, optical radiation and electromagnetic fields, and that we need to start work on the next two directives, which are also very important and affect large numbers of workers.
<d>
Mr President, I shall begin by reading a very short extract from the document that we were given today in the delegation to Central America, and I say 'read it', because I do not want anyone to believe that I am giving it my own interpretation.
The interventions I have heard so far strike me as somewhat lacking in balance.
I shall read the words of the non-governmental human rights organisation 'Human Rights Watch': 'The human rights situation clearly deteriorated in the course of last year.
In the first ten months of the year, the office of the Public Advocate recorded 92 massacres, which they defined as the killing of three or more people at the same place and at the same time.
Most were linked to paramilitary groups, followed by guerrillas. The national epidemic of kidnappings, half of which were committed by guerrillas, gave no signs of abating.?
The report also states that two million Colombians have been displaced and that this year, more people than ever before - 300 000 - have been displaced.
It also states that human rights workers, trade unionists, journalists, government investigators and community leaders continue to be murdered because of their work.
Mr President, we will be voting on a resolution today.
I prefer the resolution we voted for last year, which I felt was more balanced, because it noted and clearly condemned the ongoing fumigation of crops and the fact that alternative crops were not being promoted to prevent human disease and the constant attacks on biodiversity.
Last year's resolution also stated that the European Union should adopt a different, non-militaristic position, which supports the defence of human rights, dialogue and peace.
We repeat this demand today and I agree with my fellow Members that this should be done.
This resolution also condemned the fact that, since 60% of Colombians live on less than one dollar per day, it is very hard to achieve dialogue, agreements, or peace.
This is why, Mr President, I felt that some balance needed to be added to the previous interventions, although I agree with what most of my fellow Members have to say.
But it was necessary to mention other parties involved in the war in Colombia, who exert an enormous influence in the absence of peace.
<d>
Mr President, Commissioner Patten challenged us to justify to our electorate a demand for an increase in defence expenditure.
He is right to suggest that it would not be very popular.
However, what we can have is much more efficient and effective defence expenditure.
In Kosovo we learned that while we spend 60% of what the Americans spend, we only get 10% of their power projection.
I, as a taxpayer, would like to know what are we spending our money on in that case.
The answer to that is: waste, inefficiency and duplication, and that is the issue we have to address.
It is the Commission's job to drive that forward.
In the 1996 and 1997 communications the Commission seemed to be willing to do that.
But where the Santer Commission was prepared to go where angels feared to tread, this Commission has been cowering behind its barricades, frightened to take on the Member States on this issue and, in so doing, failing in its responsibilities to defend the Treaties.
Could Commissioner Liikanen confirm for me that the Court of Justice decisions C-70 / 94 and C-83 / 94 give the Commission the power to challenge Member States on their interpretation of Article 296, which they have taken as a carte blanche, which is not what the Treaty of Rome intends?
We want the Commission to move forward.
I welcome what Commissioner Liikanen has said, but I want to see more rapid progress.
We cannot send our troops into action unless we have the capability to support them.
As George Robertson has said, being ready for battle is like pregnancy: you either are or you are not!
You cannot proceed on the basis, as the Spanish Defence Minister has said, that we are addressing a third of our capability requirements.
Why only a third?
We have to address them all if we are serious about a European defence identity.
So I want to see this agenda being driven forward.
We need somebody with responsibility.
In football terms, we need a Roy Keane to move this agenda forward to ensure that we have the capabilities we need.
<d>
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, The EU produces 20 million hectolitres of alcohol annually, of which 13 million hectolitres are of agricultural origin and the rest of the Union's production is what is known as synthetic alcohol.
The main manufacturing industries that use ethyl alcohol are the spirit drinks industry, which represents around 30% of the European alcohol market and can only use alcohol of agricultural origin, and the chemical, pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries, which represent the other 70% and which can use both agricultural and synthetic alcohol.
Both types of alcohol, therefore, are competing in the same market.
In the past, there have been five successive attempts by the Commission to set up a COM in alcohol, but all of these attempts have come to grief in the Council.
The reasons for this failure lie in the wide variety of national systems traditionally used for alcohol in the various Member States.
The main reason is that, in principle, establishing a COM would entail dismantling national aid, as set out in Article 10 of the proposal.
This type of aid, linked to rural aid, however, can and should be maintained, not least because it does not distort the market in the current Europe of fifteen.
The arguments in favour of a Community legal framework are to improve the functioning of the single market, to ensure fair conditions of competition between operators and to help improve transparency and knowledge of marketing flows with a view to globalisation.
The global liberalisation process is the main threat to European alcohol producers.
Alcohol imports from third countries are finding it increasingly easy to gain access to the EU market due to new openings arising from preferential systems, GATT tariff-cutting agreements or bilateral negotiations with specific third countries that produce a large amount of alcohol.
Other factors which might affect development prospects for the European alcohol market at this time include the substantial levels of alcohol production in the applicant countries, future tariff reductions in the forthcoming WTO negotiations and a possible increase in bioethanol production for fuel in the European Union, that could significantly alter the horizon for traditional uses of European ethyl alcohol.
Faced with such developments, the Council of Agricultural Ministers of 17 July 2000 asked the Commission to examine the possibility of introducing a regulatory framework for agricultural alcohol, in order to improve statistical information and market transparency, as well as introducing a regime for import and export licences, and to create an appropriate management committee for the sector.
The Commission is proposing a limited scope or 'lightweight' COM, which does not involve measures under the EAGGF, but does however go further than the Council request in that, in addition to the definitions, statistics, import and export licences system, and the establishment of an appropriate management committee, the proposal also contains elements such as the possibility of establishing tariff quotas and a safeguard clause, the possibility of prohibiting or restricting inward processing arrangements and a specific provision on state aid.
The problem arises from the fact that a COM can apply only to products included in Annex I of the Treaty, which means it can apply to alcohol of agricultural origin but not to synthetic alcohol.
Given that the two types of alcohol compete with each other and are to a large extent interchangeable for most uses, the fact that the Commission is only intending to regulate alcohol of agricultural origin prompts questions about the purpose and value of rules supposedly designed to regulate the European alcohol market as a whole.
For this reason, a problem surfaced at the time of drawing up the corresponding report on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which was, what should be done with synthetic alcohol?
To add synthetic alcohol would mean having to consult the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, given that this addition would involve amendment to the legal basis of the Commission proposal.
The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market established that the dual legal basis (Articles 37 and 95) is impossible, given that the procedures that correspond to the two articles are incompatible.
As a result, faced with the impossibility of amending the proposal to include synthetic alcohol, the rapporteur proposes that the Commission should put forward a new proposal to include synthetic alcohol within its scope.
In this way it will be possible to regulate the whole ethyl alcohol market at Community level.
You will understand why the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development voted for this proposal unanimously.
A COM is probably not the appropriate instrument, but we have to bear in mind that it is the Commission that has the power of legislative initiative.
I would like to finish by asking the Commission three questions. Can you tell what stage negotiations in the Council have reached?
Is the Commission intending to withdraw the proposal?
If this is the case, does it intend to present another?
<d>
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am one of the Members whom Mr Cohn-Bendit referred to, who does not share the approach taken, although I do congratulate Mr Cohn-Bendit and General Morillon, who is unfortunately not here with us this morning, for the efforts that they have made to try to develop, using this strategic concept of 'Maghreb integration', a possible key to relations between the European Union and Maghreb.
I do not believe in this solution, because I think that it is impossible to promote integration mechanisms between such different countries, some of which are fundamentally anti-democratic, several of which are becoming increasingly so.
I wholeheartedly support the criticism of the Commission expressed by Mr Cohn-Bendit and other Members on the question of Algeria.
The question of Tunisia still remains.
I think that the problem faced by the European Union today is that of strengthening democratic opposition in these countries.
We cannot be seen to be demanding with regard to the extremely poor countries of Central or Western Africa, and totally indulgent, as we are, with Tunisia led by President Ben 'à vie' - you are aware that he has changed his name and is no longer President Ben Ali, but President Ben 'à vie' [for life].
This is the result of a referendum in which 99% of voters voted in favour of this change to the Constitution.
It is absolutely intolerable!
I would like to thank Mrs Napoletano, because we have at least managed to ensure that the Commission undertakes to no longer admit defeat by the local governments in the democratisation programmes.
I think that this reform is fundamental and we will closely monitor the way in which the Commission implements this.
I have taken careful note of the comments made by Mr Galeote Quecedo and other Members.
Specific reports must at once be drafted on each country, particularly Algeria and Tunisia.
Mr Cohn-Bendit undertook to do this in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.
I note that the Group of the European People's Party agrees with the position adopted.
Mr Esteve's comments lead me to believe that he also agrees with this.
I therefore feel that the calendar of the Committee on Foreign Affairs must include the reports on each of these countries which, I reiterate, differ greatly from one another, because most of them have very little democracy.
<d>
Mr President, I must first of all offer my congratulations and thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Marques.
I congratulate him because he has produced an excellent report responding to a demand from the Canary Islands - one of the outermost regions of the Union that has some specific tax features, supported on a sound legal basis (Article 299 (2) of the Treaty). I thank him because, through his excellent work and his flexibility, he has managed to gather a solid parliamentary majority around him which makes it seem likely that the report will be approved within the next few hours, which will put an end to a long parliamentary journey that began almost two years ago.
The economic and fiscal regime of the islands is the backbone of the statute of autonomy and self-government of the Canary Islands, the current version of which derives from the Treaty on European Union and Spain's Treaty of Accession to the European Communities, although over the centuries - ever since we were brought under the Crown of Castile, even before Castile was Spain - it has often been modified to suit the circumstances of the moment.
The question is therefore about certain historical rights, which are no lower in status than the fiscal peculiarities of Luxembourg or some of the British Isles, to mention only the case of countries where these measures have come up against some stiff opposition, paradoxical though it may seem.
Those Members who have tried - and are still trying - to change the rapporteur's text with their amendments are upholding legitimate interests - there is no doubt of that - but interests linked especially to the tobacco, alcoholic beverage and spirits lobbies, which do not now coincide with the interests of the Canary Islanders, the vast majority of whom have, through their legitimate representatives, declared their position along the lines of the Marques report.
Just as the Spanish Government has done, by virtue of its Constitution, just as the European Commission is doing - it has seen that this project is valid and does not run counter to Community law - and as is reflected by the broad agreement within the Council, which may well approve it in a few days' time, once Parliament has pronounced on it.
The Canary Islands will thus have a good economic policy instrument, which will allow them to diversify their resources and enhance their economic and social development, stop the decline of their already weak industrial sector and, if possible, stimulate its growth, especially in the food processing sector. If this happens, it will help retain jobs and create new ones in a region of high unemployment, while offering alternatives to the islands' risky dependence on the tourist industry.
The Canary Islands cannot continue to grow just on the basis of receiving a few hundred thousand more tourists every year.
This year we will have had twelve million visitors; this brings benefits, of course, but it also has sometimes devastating effects on our sustainable development: on some islands the annual number of tourists far outweighs the total number of permanent residents, generating a number of problems.
For all these reasons and others mentioned by the rapporteur and some of the speakers, this report must be approved and, as a member of the European People's Party, that is what I hope will happen.
<d>
Mr President, I should like to thank the Spanish Presidency for its undertaking to open Council meetings up to the public during the first and last readings.
That is at least a start.
We are now overtaking North Korea, which is the only country in the world that prefers to legislate behind closed doors.
We are still a long way, however, from the transparency that characterises our national parliaments when they legislate.
All other countries in the world still wish to be more open than ourselves.
Allow me also to thank the Spanish foreign minister, Mr Piqué, for the commitment he gave at the Conference of Presidents to let us have all the documents from the Council's working parties.
If that pledge is fulfilled, Spain will be able to go down in history as the presidency which opened up the EU in earnest.
That would be splendid for the country which, together with France and Germany, has traditionally combated openness.
In Seville, however, France and Luxembourg blocked a more extensive opening-up of Council meetings.
The Spanish proposal would have opened up all locations at which a certain number of stars on a document indicates that the codecision procedure is being followed.
Mr Chirac said 'no', together with Mr Jean? Claude Juncker.
I should like to call upon our fellow MEPs from France and Luxembourg to give their ministers a lesson in openness and parliamentary democracy.
A comment, now, on the famous telephone conversation between Mr Prodi and Mr Aznar.
Would you propose a treaty amendment entitling all prime ministers to telephone the President of the Commission on a Sunday in order to have a proposal deferred and inconvenient officials dismissed on the Monday?
<d>
It is time to take stock, Mr Aznar.
You gave your presidency the motto 'More Europe'.
What happened to that?
What happened, apart from the pats on the back you are giving yourself?
The fight against terrorism was one of your priorities.
You were reminded here that beyond this essential fight, political problems needed to be addressed politically.
You prefer decrees to dialogue.
In Spain and elsewhere, terrorism thrives when politics turns a blind eye.
Enlargement was one of your priorities.
As they say in rugby, you kicked the common agricultural policy, finance and aid to future Member States into touch and sent the ball to the Danish Presidency's end.
Lastly, let us consider Seville, a town besieged by protesters in a country paralysed by the general strike.
You should have ridden the wave of fear in Europe, the wave of hatred for Le Pen, Haider and Berlusconi.
The tension should have been focused on the world's villains, who deserved to be punished for their crimes.
You allowed Mr Chirac to pass for a progressive in return for very little.
Mr Chirac!
To us, the separatists of the Esquerre Républica de Catalunya, this is what you have achieved: 'Less Europe', 'Bisque Catalunya', 'Bisque Europe'.
<d>
On behalf of the Liberal Group, I should also like to express our satisfaction.
The result obtained at the conciliation stage, and I must emphasise this, would not have been possible without the perseverance of Professor Trakatellis, or without the constructive cooperation between the delegation of our Parliament, the Spanish Presidency and the staff of Commissioner Byrne.
Despite the bitter negotiations concerned, essentially, with budgetary aspects, the three institutions wanted, above all, to send a joint message to the citizens of Europe.
Health is now one of our main priorities, and we should be proud of this, because it was essential that Europe should, as it were 'look after its health' and should at last put in place a comprehensive and integrated strategy on this subject.
The lack of food safety, and the increase in the consumption of alcohol and tobacco, particularly among young people, mean that we need, more than ever before, this type of coordinated action at Community level in order to prevent diseases.
As for the resurgence of scourges such as Aids or tuberculosis, or the emergence - as has been mentioned - of acts of bio-terrorism, they have made it necessary for the Union to have this rapid reaction capacity.
So many reasons and concerns justify an appropriate budget for the next six years.
The verdict has been given: EUR 312 million will be paid out, in addition to a Commission declaration making provision for a review of the financial framework in the light of enlargement and the new financial perspective.
Admittedly this is less than the EUR 380 million that we were hoping for, but nevertheless it is much more than the EUR 280 million initially granted by the Council.
We can therefore say that this compromise is a victory for our Parliament and that, in this House, political will, rather than budgetary dogmatism, has won the day.
<d>
Mr President, I should like to make a point of thanking Mrs Smet for her report on the scoreboard on implementing the social policy agenda.
As she quite rightly points out, the social policy agenda for the years 2000 to 2006 is the first common commitment adopted, including by the Council, and the first European charter of social commitments and actions.
The first year, 2001, was a special case which we discussed last year.
It was the first year we ran it and it had serious shortcomings and problems.
This year, we have our first detailed scoreboard, containing a step by step analysis of the progress made in this particular policy area.
The comment last year was that the description only applied to the Commission.
I think it is clear that, this year, we have a detailed description of all the agencies involved in each action.
One example is the proposal for socially sensitive restructuring in the business sector, which describes the role of the Commission, the European Parliament, the social agencies, the social partners, governments and civil society.
Of course I agree with Mrs Smet and her comment in the report that we should always look forward as well as back, i.e. not just to how specific agencies have been involved but also to the objectives they have set for the following stages.
The following stages will be examined to a certain extent in the first mid-term review in 2003.
The period from 2003 to 2005 is also important. There will be an initial progress report and we shall be able to make any changes deemed necessary.
I should point out here that the European Parliament will be fully involved in this mid-term review because as Mrs Smet says, and I am sure no-one disagrees, Europe's basic ally in all social policy proposals is the European Parliament. It is more often than not Parliament which is the driving force behind the European Union in social policy.
I should like to comment on three points which I feel are instrumental to the debate.
First that, with cooperation between the Commission and the European Parliament, most of the social policy agenda initiatives planned for 2000 to 2002 have been brought to a successful conclusion or are under way.
Secondly, as has already been mentioned, we have found a modus operandi with the method of open cooperation between the Member States and, to a certain extent, a way of including the role of Parliament in this method.
Of course, this is a first step and what we need to do is identify the basic, fundamental role of the European Parliament and this is something the Convention will need to address.
The third point is that, as with the European Parliament, we need to find a legal basis for involving civil society in discussions in the Convention.
I should like to make a point of thanking the European Parliament for its constructive cooperation.
We look forward to receiving your individual comments.
<d>
Mr President, the first task of anyone who has served on the Conciliation Committee must be to congratulate Mrs Paulsen for her drive and tenacity in surviving a complex conciliation which was at times almost overturned by some very unorthodox manoeuvres.
That would not have been right for Parliament, and I am glad that the various parties to this agreement converged in this way.
Mrs Paulsen had to keep her nerve because events elsewhere, including elections, were bringing special pressures to bear on the way in which these events were being looked at.
Yet she was vindicated the whole time by the saga of continuing food contamination scandals which went on in a number of Member States right through 2002 and in the way in which this matter has worked out.
We know all about full traceability for specified risk materials in the United Kingdom because we were forced in the wake of BSE to introduce, almost at gun-point, something which is now going to be uniform across the Community.
This is all to the good.
I believe that the number of by-products that have found their way into the food chain this year show us that perhaps even now, and later when this regulation is fully enforced, there will still need to be vigilance to ensure that above all else the principle of separation is rigorously upheld.
I turn to the questions mentioned already by Mr Goodwill regarding the problem some Member States have experienced.
I am glad that we have found a solution which leaves a temporary period of transition, rather than shrugging aside the need to bring this matter to a conclusion.
I make no comment on the situation as regards the Austrian and German industries and confine myself to the United Kingdom.
In the United Kingdom we had certain specific problems: perhaps the Commissioner can make a note of them, because in the final statement we will need to see how these are addressed in connection with the transition.
The first question, familiar to Mr Goodwill, is of small incinerators which have been used as an extremely sensible way of destroying fallen stock on site with the minimum period of contamination risk.
We need to be sure, during the transition period for inspection, that the reasons why these have been used, and used effectively, are fully understood by the Commission and that they are not simply arbitrarily removed from the scene.
The second area is the question of cooking oil.
The United Kingdom is now prepared to accept, rightly, that the transition period should be two years instead of four years and that in that time, given that this whole directive is only going to take effect something like eight or nine months from now, there will have been an adequate period for the industry concerned to adjust its practices - and probably its profits - to other ways of disposing of this, particularly in the field of biofuels.
Lastly, I am glad the United Kingdom withdrew its objections relating to the application for a transition period for the land application of blood from slaughterhouses.
This is a pretty repulsive habit.
We could not have justified it and am glad that the United Kingdom withdrew its objections.
In this matter, too, the principle of cleanliness and separation should be paramount.
Mrs Paulsen has showed us the way and it is up to us to follow.
<d>
Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, we have been calling for a Commission proposal to solve the institutional problems that exist.
It is at long last before us, and we welcome that.
Your paper makes a further interesting and important contribution to the work of the Convention, but it does not provide a total solution for all institutional problems. It does cast some light on the Commission's position regarding a whole raft of issues.
For example, majority voting in the Council as a general rule, which we welcome. Majority voting by Parliament on legislation as a general rule, which we also welcome.
Bringing justice and home affairs within the Community framework, which is also good, and the creation of a Secretary of the Union for foreign affairs as Vice-President of the Commission with a special relationship with the Council, that is fine, and it represents a workable compromise as a means of solving a difficult problem. And there is much more besides.
I can see many positive points in your proposals.
However, in some areas, Mr Prodi, your proposals do not make things clearer - they just create greater confusion.
Let me pick out one of them in particular.
This is the issue of the appointment and political responsibility of the Commission.
You are suggesting that the European Parliament should elect the President of the Commission.
That is a good proposal, and a much-needed step forward.
But at the same time you say that this President of the Commission must be elected by a two-thirds majority of the European Parliament, which prevents the results of the European elections from being reflected in a decision regarding an appointment at European Union level. In other words it prevents something from happening that is precisely what you want: it prevents voters from deciding who they want as Commission President for the next five years.
This means building in a permanent compromise, rather like the permanent grand coalition in Austria.
We cannot and we will not go along with that!
The second issue is that the European Council is to confirm the election of the President of the Commission by the European Parliament.
How is that to happen?
By a majority or unanimously?
What do you have in mind?
And if the Council does not confirm the President, what then?
Does Parliament have the right to dissolve the Council?
That is what I would suggest.
Your proposals do not include any mechanisms for resolving conflicts.
Ultimately, and this really takes the biscuit, the Commission is accountable to both Parliament and the Council.
So how will that work out in practice?
Will you resign every time?
If Parliament says that it has confidence in you, will you stay, and if the Council says you must resign, will you resign?
What sort of message does that send about building the institutions of the European Union?
It is simply a recipe for confusion!
Mr President of the Commission, your proposal in this respect creates more problems than it solves, and the European Parliament regards what you want to tell us is a step forward as actually being two steps back!
<d>
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I wish to begin by reiterating my solidarity with the Galician people and with all the communities who might be affected by this tragedy, in Spain, in France and, of course, in my own country.
As time passes, the true scale of this disaster is becoming ever clearer.
I hope that the investigation requested by Parliament will be undertaken in a thorough and timely manner.
And, as I have already said in this Chamber, we must also clear up the mysterious change of direction taken by the ship which, after moving westwards, turned suddenly towards the South, until it sank, thirty miles outside Portuguese waters.
What we need to do now, however, is to talk more about the future and this is why I would like to address four issues.
Firstly, the European Union must provide funds to compensate, as much as possible, for the damage caused by the oil slick.
In this context, I believe we would be justified in mobilising the EU Solidarity Fund, which has not yet been done.
The second aspect is that since this has clearly had a terrible effect on fishing and shellfish farming, we must consider a more integrated and far-reaching package of measures that will provide practical responses for the communities that have been affected.
The third aspect is that a technically and scientifically justified decision must be taken on what to do with the ship, which is now lying on the ocean floor with its 60 000 tonnes of oil.
Unless this is resolved, we will be condemned not only to an oil slick but to a succession of oil slicks for months and years to come.
Lastly, I wish to emphasise that it is now time to properly establish the European Maritime Safety Agency, which means that the Council must agree on where it should be based.
To conclude, I wish to say that we want there to be a rigorous inquiry, as Parliament has already called for.
What we do not want is for Parliament to be used to debate a country's domestic problems.
<d>
Mr President, credit is certainly due to the Danish Presidency for producing a more judicious immigration policy, particularly as regards questions such as the very sensitive issue of asylum, for policies on these matters have, for a long time, in practice, actually tended to encourage illegal immigration.
However, although we are more aware of the dangers related to illegal immigration, that does not mean that the Union has practically implemented all the most effective measures for opposing it, such as, for example, readmission agreements with third countries, which must progress much faster and be much more practical, given that - as we are all aware - the Union has strong tangible grounds for putting pressure on these countries.
On the coasts of southern Italy, the flow of illegal immigrants ferried to the country by sea continues, despite the adoption of new, more stringent criminal legislation against traffickers, precisely because there has been no fall in the support or complicity traffickers enjoy in countries such as Albania or Turkey.
The measures announced to combat illegal immigration include the project for a European police force to deal with all border control, not just control of sea borders, although this police force must be properly trained.
This project must be given full support and pursued without delay, and proper training in this field must be given to the police forces of the new Member States, which will very soon have to address these issues - if they are not already addressing them - for their borders will become ours in this respect too.
There is, however, another important warning bell which it is our duty to ring too: we cannot continue to turn a blind eye to a number of proven cases of active members of Bin Laden's network who have penetrated our cities as regular immigrants in order to prepare the ground, as has recently been discovered in France, for biological weapons attacks, possibly with what are known as dirty bombs containing nuclear waste.
This danger is now present within Europe.
We must take care that we do not help those intending to bring about incidents similar to those which took place in New York, Mombassa or Bali with excessively generous provision.
<d>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I feel that we must take the opportunity afforded by Mr Napolitano's report - and all credit is due to him for succeeding in this difficult, complex task - to stress, with all the institutional weight of the European Parliament, the need for the new Europe, which will be founded on the Constitutional Treaty on which the Convention is working, to apply the principle of subsidiarity completely and transparently.
This means that the result will only be achieved if subsidiarity is not just applied to relations between the Union and the national States but is extended to the territorial authorities - the regional and local authorities - with all due respect for the constitutional systems of the respective countries, of course.
Indeed, it is the territorial authorities - the regional and local authorities - alone which give substance to the democracy of proximity. It is they that make it possible to strengthen the roots of genuine democracy and to bring the citizens closer to the institutions, including the European institutions.
The Convention is the forum which has been assigned the task of resolving this thorny issue.
It started off focusing its attention solely on the first level of subsidiarity, the subsidiarity between the Union and the States.
We need to free ourselves from this trap because, if we endorse this system of two levels of subsidiarity - subsidiarity between the Union and the States and between the States and the territorial authorities - we prevent - and I feel that this is the crux of the matter - recognition of that direct connection between the European institutions and the territorial authorities which now exists and which is yielding promising fruit, where it is not misinterpreted or destroyed at birth.
We must resist this temptation at all costs and, to this end, I hope that the Convention will take on board the lengthy debate which has taken place in Europe, particularly in the Council of Europe, on the matter.
My hope is that the Convention will succeed in recognising and endorsing the right to local and regional autonomy.
This right will then be regulated within the respective legal systems of the individual countries but will have to comprise the single level of subsidiarity, the equal dignity of levels of government, the right of local autonomies to their own financial resources and the right to have access to justice, which can balance the technical needs to prevent this getting out of control against the needs of the territorial authorities, but which cannot stop it happening.
It may be that the idea of strengthening the link through the Committee of the Regions is the solution we all need.
<d>
The Council feels that we should respect the institutional role of the UN Security Council and the role it plays in the world order in general.
Basically, we want to see what happens and what decisions the Security Council will take.
Whether the inspectors are or are not effective and how they evaluate the overall situation will be assessed once they have submitted their report.
The European Union as such is not pressing one way or the other.
However, the Greek Presidency is determined, and it has stated as much, that if a war is in the offing, it will make every effort to ensure the European Union plays its part.
As far as the American bases in the European Union are concerned, they were not, I think, the subject of the question and I shall not therefore express a view on them.
<d>
Mr President, I hope that my good friend Thomas Mann has forgiven me for not voting for the report in committee, and indeed that he will forgive me again, as he knows I will not be supporting it in the plenary.
There are many points that I welcome in his report; the recognition of the need to deliver the Lisbon conclusions, the encouragement and support for SMEs and the need to improve employment of disadvantaged groups in society.
But I do not accept the basic thrust of the report that one of the solutions is to strengthen the roles of the social partners.
I am all for social dialogue, but this should be between employees and employers within their companies.
The rapporteur confirmed the importance of SMEs as the motor of employment, but SMEs have only a tiny voice within UNICE and most of their employees do not have membership of trade unions.
So within the social partners their voice goes virtually unheard, and yet the social partners presume to speak for them.
There was an interesting report in the UK press at the weekend about Germany: Chancellor Schröder was apparently finding it increasingly difficult to get acceptance of much-needed labour market reforms because the social partners were blocking them.
A German minister was quoted as saying 'when it becomes necessary to drain the swamp, you don't stand around asking the frogs'.
With unemployment approaching 5 million in that country, the swamp is getting bigger and the need for change is very clear.
So I am all for social justice and social inclusion, but the biggest enemy of both is unemployment.
Governments need to do what is necessary to address this.
Clinging on to outdated concepts does not help; strengthening the role of the social partners simply leads to more paralysis.
If some countries wish to persist in this, it is of course up to them.
But please, rapporteur, please, Commissioner, do not inflict such concepts on the rest of us.
<d>
- (NL) External military interventions are usually a bad thing, as they involve a major power trying to impose its will on the warring parties from outside, without the consent of those parties. Or they involve taking sides and giving support to one warring party based on the major power's own interests or ideologies.
That is what people call 'peace-enforcing', the imposition of peace.
Peace that is not supported by the parties involved will lead to a resumption of conflict after the withdrawal of the new occupiers.
My party, the Socialist Party in the Netherlands, repudiates wars like those in Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq, nor do we support the construction of an integrated EU army.
We do support 'peace keeping', helping to maintain peace at the request of both parties in a conflict.
This is geared to keeping the warring parties apart and avoiding new disasters.
This is why we support this kind of military presence in Cyprus, Kosovo and Macedonia.
If the UN does not bear the direct responsibility for this, then better the EU than NATO with its bias toward American war policy.
That is why I am voting against the majority of the GUE / NGL Group and for the EU taking over peace-keeping responsibilities in the north-west of the Republic of Macedonia.
<d>
Mr President, the current situation lends a great deal of weight to the opening sequence of Roman Polanski's award-winning film 'The Pianist', released last year, which showed a Polish family joyfully celebrating with champagne when it is announced that the French and British have declared war to go to the aid of Polish democracy in September 1939.
The rest of the film shows the extent of the suffering awaiting the family.
These images are useful in that they temper the confidence we might have today in a cause which, ultimately, is just, and our hopes for a democratic future for Iraq, and add a human aspect.
For, as a last resort, the combat taking place will set soldiers from democratic States against a totalitarian State.
And in the face of such a situation, it is impossible to remain neutral.
Mr President, war is an evil, but in some cases it can be the lesser of two evils.
The war has begun and Europe has been unable to prevent it.
We must therefore do all we can, Europe must do all it can to ensure that this war is the lesser evil.
<d>
(DE) I abstained when the vote was taken on the accession of the Czech Republic to the EU.
What was decisive in my doing so was the fact that the government in Prague does not think it necessary to distance itself from the decrees of the one-time President Bene?, which declared to be lawful the gravest offences - including murder - committed against Germans, Austrians and Hungarians in the course of their being expelled.
It is not acceptable that the Czech parliament, in April 2002, should affirm that this sort of expulsion was' unquestionable, inviolable and unchangeable '.
An essential part of my work in the European Parliament has to do with ensuring that human rights are secured, the rule of law defended and minorities protected.
These principles are among the Copenhagen criteria, which have to be met by all states desirous of joining the EU.
It is compliance with these conditions - not only with those of the acquis communautaire - on which their ability to accede depends.
As the Czechs have not met these conditions, a no vote on my part, directed at the actions of those who hold political responsibility in their country, would be absolutely justified.
As, though, we are not voting on governments, but on states and their peoples, I abstained today.
I hope that the citizens of the Czech Republic will, after their country's accession, gain a deeper understanding of the community of values and laws that is the EU.
<d>
Mr President, allow me to reply to some of the points that have been raised.
Firstly the question as to whether this is an interim solution.
In my view, the Commission proposal with our amendments can be the basis for a solution to the comitology problem that is compatible both with the current treaty and with what is likely to come out of the European Convention.
Of course, the Convention must do its work and get rid of the apparent contradictions between Articles 202 and 251 of the Treaty, and perhaps put some of the principles governing the delegation of implementing powers into the Treaty and into the constitution itself, but in my view what we are doing here could be entirely convergent with the work going on in the Convention.
Secondly, despite the great convergence we have achieved in general, I would like to mention the issue of the two points which, according to Mr Bourlanges, the PPE-DE Group intends to vote against.
I must say I disagree with the PPE-DE Group on this and I would point out that the position that I am defending is based on what was adopted by Parliament in Mr Bourlanges' own report.
So I am consistent with what is in Parliament's position up to now, and, indeed, in our own Rules of Procedure, where we have called upon the President of Parliament to ask the Commission to withdraw or modify any implementing measure that Parliament objects to, or to bring forward a legislative proposal.
So I am on the solid ground of what Parliament has consistently argued for over time in this and I would hope that the PPE-DE Group would rethink its position before we vote in half an hour's time.
Also, on the question of the provisional adoption of a text pending the legislative procedure, this is important in certain circumstances in order to avoid a legal vacuum.
The measure applies provisionally while Parliament and the Council go through a legislative procedure to review it, amend it or repeal it, depending on what we decide to do.
But it can also be important to have a stopgap solution without a legal vacuum pending that legislative procedure.
In other words, I am asking for a menu of options.
If Parliament or Council objects to an implementing measure that the Commission has put forward, the Commission can either withdraw it - I think it has that right implicitly under the Treaty anyway but let us make that explicit - or it can amend it to take account of our objections, or it can put forward a legislative proposal.
If it does the latter it can apply the measure provisionally, if this is necessary to avoid a legal vacuum, or not if that is not necessary.
That range of opportunities is, I think, appropriate.
We should maintain the full list and I hope the PPE-DE Group will rethink its position and vote accordingly.
<d>
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in my opinion, the key element in this debate today on foot and mouth disease is the constraints imposed by the OIE with regard to the trade sanctions inflicted on countries that no longer enjoy 'foot and mouth disease free' status.
It is these rules that make this disease so terrifying for breeders because of the huge economic losses they cause.
We must remember that the foot and mouth that affects livestock is not dangerous to man.
It is not a public health problem.
I therefore endorse our rapporteur's proposal in Amendment No 5 to recital 14 to the effect that the Member States should submit proposals to the OIE to modify trade sanctions in these situations.
To be more precise, this change to the OIE rules must take two forms.
Firstly, consideration must be given to the progress made on vaccines - marker vaccines, which make it possible to distinguish a vaccinated animal from an infected animal, and more general vaccines - and we must remember that products from vaccinated animals - dairy or meat - pose no danger to human health nor any risk of contagion.
Therefore, there is no longer any reason to discriminate against these products or the countries where they are available.
This change to the rules will also make it possible to reconsider the problem of preventive vaccination, which should be authorised by the Member States in cases where, for their own reasons, the breeders so desire.
I am thinking in particular of animals with a high genetic value, breeding animals and rare breeds that are important for biodiversity.
Secondly, Member States must be allowed to regionalise their breeding areas, thereby ensuring that a case of foot and mouth in Alsace - speaking hypothetically of course - does not prevent Brittany from exporting its excellent animal produce.
Finally, and I am sorry that this point that I raised during the work of our Temporary Committee on Foot and Mouth Disease was not taken up by the rapporteur, we must not lose sight of the fact that certain changes in European agriculture, which have been facilitated by shifts in a certain CAP, are in themselves risk factors for the spread of diseases.
I am referring to the increase in the size of farms, excessive intensification, the spread of enclosed breeding, the specialisation of regions and the transporting of animals over long distances: all of these factors, which combine to create very high animal densities, increase the risk.
At a time, Mr President, when Parliament will have to state its position on the mid-term review of the CAP, we must endeavour to remedy these shifts rather than amplify them by giving priority to human-sized farms, extensive breeding in the least favoured regions, the local integration of activities and local abattoirs; in short, agriculture with a human face.

Mr President, I would like to thank the Commission and Mr Cunha for their hard work.
We in the British Conservative delegation reluctantly took the decision that we were unable to support the recommendations in the Cunha report.
We see the need for reform, and the need for reform for our farmers.
Therefore we cannot support horizontal or partial decoupling and as that was an integral part of Mr Cunha's report, we are unable to support that.
However, we support the Commission in its legislative resolution and want the Council to come to an agreement as soon as it possibly can.
We believe that the Commission's proposals are along the right lines.
I would add that Mr Cunha is an esteemed Member of this House; he is also a personal friend.
However, we believe, and I personally believe, that farmers need security.
Mr Cunha's report would probably mean a second reform and we could not accept it.

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the chairman of the socialist group of the European Parliament spoke just now about the Odyssey of the Greek Presidency.
It was indeed an Odyssey which floated between the Circe of the war in Iraq - perhaps I should remind you that Circe was a wicked witch who had the ability to turn men into pigs - and the good goddess Calypso of the Convention on the Future of Europe which may guide the European Ulysses to the safe haven of the Europe of his dreams.
As Europeans and as Greeks, we can be proud of this success, however unhappy we are about the incidents of war we had to address.
The Greek Presidency undertook to address both the issue of Iraq and the differences which this war provoked between the Member States of the European Union and between the European Union and the United States.
At the summit Councils in February and March, with the promotion and exploitation of the role of the United Nations, the European Union acquired a material presence on the international stage.
Public opinion in the European countries recognised and welcomed the contribution by the Community institutions.
The European Union is based not only on the principles of democracy, but also on the rejection in principle of war in international relations.
The Member States, who have a very bloody history of conflict between them, no longer arm themselves against each other.
These principles now need to be consolidated between the Member States, the candidate countries and Europe and its new neighbours as a whole.
The Greek Presidency was persistent in its efforts to disseminate these principles in the new and sometimes dangerous areas of responsibility into which enlargement has led Europe.
Problems in sensitive areas, such as Cyprus, which the Foreign Ministers in the area have called a sort of powder magazine of the Eastern Mediterranean, were addressed methodically and consistently.
Cyprus, if there is the cooperation expected from the Turkish side which, unfortunately, there has still not been but we hope that there will be, can constitute a standard for the coexistence of different nations within the same state.
In the same spirit, the Greek Presidency especially promoted the peace process in the Middle East.
The current diplomatic procedures in this region are also the result of initiatives by the Greek Presidency.
From a wider perspective, it is worth highlighting the guidelines given for the formulation of a new strategy by the European Union, which was worked out down to the last detail by the Council's High Representative.
The promotion of European pacifist positions in the Western Balkans and the summit in Thessaloniki resulted, with its decisions, in a significant turn round in relations between Europe and the Western Balkans.
With these efforts the world did not become completely safe, but we can say that, thanks to these efforts, the Greek Presidency has bequeathed a much easier or, at least, less difficult task to its successor than it would have had without the methodical, consistent and sometimes inspired work of the Greek Presidency not intervened.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, many of you have heard of Ingrid Betancourt, representative of Colombia's Green Party, whose relatives have visited this House on several occasions.
It is now a year and a half since she was kidnapped by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).
The position of the family and the Colombian Green Party, as well as the European Parliament's Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance, has been to encourage a humanitarian exchange, whilst criticising FARC and saying that it is unacceptable to propose a political exchange.
Yesterday, the Colombian press received a cassette containing a threefold message from Ingrid Betancourt: firstly, if you want to mount a military operation in order to set me free then go ahead, but be careful!
Secondly, humanitarian exchanges can only take place between armies and thirdly, as far as we are concerned - we, the politicians who have been kidnapped - only FARC can give us an unconditional release.
I believe that this message, surprising as it is, can be explained both by the extreme courage of Ingrid Betancourt on the one hand, who does not hesitate to take risks in the name of her political principles and, on the other, by FARC's desire to show that they are prepared to allow their prisoner to appeal to public opinion, even if only to say 'attack us!'
What I would ask, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, is that we give firm support to Ingrid Betancourt's third proposal, which is to clearly ask FARC to release all their political prisoners unilaterally, because it is unacceptable to take negotiators or representatives of the people hostage.
<d>
Mr President, the Commission welcomes the peace agreement signed by the belligerent parties, civil society and political parties of the country on 18 August 2003.
We are still concerned about the ongoing fighting.
It is very important that ECOWAS fully deploys its peacekeeping troops to ensure that the peace agreement is respected on the ground.
The figure available to me as to how many troops have actually been deployed is 2127.
ECOWAS is doing what it is expected to do.
We hope that the presence of this force will permit a rapid resumption of humanitarian assistance and an end to the atrocities that, especially for women and children, have been terrible in Liberia.
We have been informed by ECOWAS that deployment should be completed by 9 September 2003.
It has appointed a special representative for Liberia to oversee the conduct of the peacekeeping force and monitor the implementation of the peace agreement.
ECOWAS is not in a position to carry the financial burden of these operations alone, and following the proposal from the Commission the Council decided to make EUR 50 million available to support the peace process broadly defined in Liberia.
This money comes from allocated funds for Liberia that were never used: because of the situation we could not work there normally.
For both the 7th and the 8th EDF, Liberia was more or less out of the circuit.
Some things were possible, but only very little.
About EUR 8 million of the EUR 50 million are earmarked to support the ECOWAS peace-keeping operation and for the creation of the office of the special representative.
The remaining funds should be used for a demobilisation and reintegration programme as well as for institution-building and the restoration of democratic structures.
In this regard, I was pleased to listen to Mr Posselt's contribution.
These were wise words warning against the arrogant approach of taking it for granted that a rapid process of elections does it.
This, unfortunately, is not the case.
We need to be pragmatic and rediscover the practical value of the notion of governance.
First stability or peace, then governance, then democratisation and then democracy itself.
We have to be pragmatic and not allow ourselves to surrender to the temptation of prescribing those nice things that we take for granted here in our environment.
We have to show confidence and be a more realistic partner.
Liberia has been going through the most terrible, traumatic times.
We also welcome the UN Security Council decision to establish a stabilisation force for Liberia to take over responsibility from ECOWAS as from 1 October 2003.
Also, the contributions from Sweden, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom for the peacekeeping force in Liberia are very welcome and we see a strong case for mobilising what I would now call 'partnership stamina'.
We tried, over the years, to do something meaningful in Liberia, but with Mr Taylor around this was almost impossible.
Regionally, it is extremely important that the opportunity now at hand is not missed.

. (FR) This report embodies a number of contradictions.
The most obvious of these is that Parliament is in favour of opening up the IGC but only in order to ensure that it achieves nothing.
Overall, the majority does appear to be highly satisfied with the results achieved by the Convention, but cannot deny that the major and recurring problems, such as a lack of democracy, transparency and effectiveness have still not been resolved.
As regards the detail, every proposal contradicts the commitment to diversity and to respect for democracy, because attempts are still being made to impose a uniform and binding supranational law.
The Chasse Pêche Nature Traditions (CPNT) Members of the European Parliament's Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities (EDD) feel that the Convention's method makes the same mistake that besets all diplomatic negotiations.
The decision was taken within a circle consisting of a chosen few, which seeks to impose its point of view, as has been the case since the beginnings of Community integration.
The only aspect of the draft drawn up by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs was the last paragraph, which consented to seek the citizens' by referendum in the States whose constitution allows this.
It is to this test of truth that the proposals on the future of Europe must really be subject, by allowing a genuinely open debate on which everyone can take a stance.

– Mr President, are taxes only a means of generating income for the treasury, or can they also be used to serve other purposes of government policy?
This is, in actual fact, the underlying core question on which I, with others, and Commissioner Bolkestein fundamentally differ.
What is more, it looks like he is increasingly on his own in his puritan rejection of the use of the instrument of reduced rates of VAT, which is still being deployed as an experiment, to promote employment.
At the time of the autumn 1997 employment summit in Luxembourg, the idea of reduced rates of VAT was mooted here in this Parliament.
This idea already met with resistance then from the Directorate-General dealing with tax cases and from a number of Member States.
Despite this, it was decided to carry out, in a very select number of labour-intensive sectors, an experiment which would definitely not result in any cross-border distortion of competition.
It was in these that the Member States were allowed to apply the reduced rates of VAT.
However, it had to remain an experiment, limited in time.
People could not agree beforehand on clear criteria whereby the experiment could be assessed.
This evaluation was also done too late, the experiment had to be extended first, and the evaluation was left up to the Member States and badly coordinated.
In the Netherlands, the first evaluation report met with strong criticism, and a re-appraisal done at the request of parliament yielded many positive results.
I do not have the time to enter into the detail of this, but I think that you are familiar with those reports.
I have noted nonetheless that, eventually, you only adopted the negative tenor of those evaluations and have written the experiment off with what amounts to only the prejudices that preceded the experiment.
There was wide indignation in the Netherlands about the simple termination of an experiment that had been found to be effective for hairdressers, cobblers, decorators and bicycle repairers – and this in times of recession, no less.
After all, you do not need economic models in order to figure out for yourself that the re-introduction of the high rates will cost a very large number of jobs.
I am delighted that this indignation is widely shared in this House as well.
Moreover, the following logic is applied here: if there are no cross-border or competitively distorting effects, why would the EU prohibit Member States from applying the VAT rates that they think are sound?
Why would governments and parliaments not be allowed to weigh up for themselves the goals to collect as many taxes as possible or to promote employment and make moonlighting legal?
The Council of Ecofin Ministers has now also clearly and unanimously announced its wish to extend the experiment and to remove the current uncertainty for those involved.
In my view, your response in this matter to ignore this request and only to promise to tolerate the illegal continuation of the experiment does not show much respect for European rules and for the way they are implemented in the Member States. 'Tolerance' – surely that can only be intended as a joke on the part of the Commission as Guardian of the Treaty?
I should therefore like to urge the Commissioner once again to make a definite, formal proposal to extend the experiment, and to do so before the end of this month, and definitely before 1 January 2004.
After all, it is quite clear that there is wide support here in the European Parliament to include the experiment of Annex K in a structural insertion of these labour-intensive services in Annex H of the Directive.
It is also clear, though, that this will not be done before 1 January.
The sooner the structural facility becomes operational, the better.
This will receive our unqualified support and as long as that is not the case, the experiment must remain in force on a formal footing.
<d>
. Mr President –, the Commission shares Parliament's concerns on the political situation in Côte d'Ivoire.
Even if some progress has been made in the implementation of the Marcoussis Agreement, the current deadlock has to be broken.
The new forces have been boycotting the Council of Ministers for two months and this boycott, as well as the mutual lack of trust, makes it impossible to launch the demobilisation, disarmament and reintegration process which is a prerequisite for the reunification of the country.
There are still severe violations of human rights and the Commission is also very concerned about the humanitarian situation.
Since the outbreak of the conflict in September 2002 the Commission has provided EUR 7.24 million for emergency relief operations in Côte d'Ivoire and it will continue to provide humanitarian assistance in 2004 in the framework of the global plan for coastal West Africa.
The European Union is actively involved in the implementation of the Marcoussis Agreement, both financially and politically.
Since the beginning of the crisis on 19 September 2002, it has issued nine declarations and has repeatedly urged all Ivorians to work in harmony for the reunification of the country and the preparation of peaceful democratic elections in 2005.
In Abidjan the Commission, as well as the EU presidency, is a member of the monitoring committee of the Marcoussis Agreement.
The 10 signatories of the agreement recommended the creation of its international committee in order to ensure its implementation.
The committee has been quite active.
Since its first meeting at the end of February it has met more than 50 times, but still its action has been criticised by all 10 political forces apart from President Gbagbo's party, the FPI.
Discussions should quickly take place between all members of the committee on how to improve its efficiency.
To restore its credibility the committee should undertake a thorough rethinking of its current role, not only to act as an arbitrator but also primarily to work in a more open manner in order to create more confidence as to how its work is viewed.
A kind of duty reporting to headquarters should be established, with minutes from the meetings to improve its transparency with regard to the institutions represented within this committee.
It has been too inward-looking in the way it has functioned and changes there could be productive.
But what is most important is to ensure that the political players in Côte d'Ivoire really understand the need to create a spirit of coexistence and compromise.
They must make an effort to get along within one nation.
Without that attitude it will be very difficult to create real progress.
As far as the Union's capacity in conflict prevention, management and resolution is concerned, efforts are being undertaken to define a relevant common strategy.
The main aspects of this entail strengthening regional integration through support to ECOWAS, reinforcing coordination with the UN and enhancing national and regional political dialogue.
All this is something we are directly engaged in and we do what we can in all these relations.
The initiatives of the African Union on peace and security, as well as actions against the illicit exploitation of natural resources, will be taken into account as part of this process.
I find it quite correct that Parliament is looking at these aspects in this kind of situation.
Concerning Mrs McKenna's amendments to suspend the fisheries agreement with Côte d Ivoire ’ because of inconsistencies in EC policies and because it is not possible to control national waters, I would like to make the following point.
The Commission has suggested extending the fisheries agreement for one year, taking into consideration that, with this agreement, Côte d Ivoire ’ will continue to benefit from targeted actions for scientific research, control and surveillance.
The activities and the training of the Fisheries Ministry and investment in the Côte d Ivoire economy ’, mainly through the three tuna factories, are guaranteed only if the agreement is extended.
Bankruptcy of the tuna canneries, currently generating 5 000 direct local jobs and more than 30 000 indirect jobs, would create a great deal of unemployment and could possibly lead to social unrest in Abidjan.
It would also mean that the port of Abidjan would be definitely doomed as a fish-landing port for probably several years to come.
There is no doubt that a failure to extend the agreement would have far-reaching negative consequences and could only deepen the current crisis in Côte d Ivoire ’, so I would not recommend pulling this element into a situation which is already problematic enough.
<d>
. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen –, the embargo on the export of weapons to the People's Republic of China was adopted by the European Union in 1989 following the events in Tiananmen Square.
The embargo permitted only exports not associated with repressive activities or with activities violating Human Rights, to be examined on a case-by-case basis.
China believes that the embargo is now out of date and that the level of cooperation in all sectors between China and Europe, as well as the rapid changes underway in the People's Republic of China, are such as to justify it being lifted.
This fact is being more and more frequently and vehemently stressed on every possible occasion, both multilateral and bilateral, by our Chinese interlocutors, who have recently pinpointed the lifting of the embargo as a short- or medium-term priority in China s relations ’ with the European Union.
From the point of view of the implications, were the embargo against China to be lifted, the European Code of Conduct would, in any case remain applicable, the result being that, in reality, weapons exportation would not vary substantially.
The matter of the possible lifting of the embargo has, in recent months, been discussed in the European Union but consensus has not been reached on whether this revision is appropriate.
The European Union acknowledges that, between 1989 and today, the political situation in China has evolved significantly and that important changes have taken place in the European Union's relations with China, including the quality of political dialogue.
Indeed, with the establishment of the EU-China Dialogue on Human Rights, an important vehicle has been created in which both sides can exchange opinions and develop projects aimed at fostering tangible improvements.
Furthermore, and the Chinese are placing particular emphasis on this, the Chinese Government underwent a complete change at the Party Congress held last year and today's leaders declare that they had nothing to do with the events of Tiananmen Square.
Nevertheless, from the standpoint of the European Union, whose public opinion still vividly recalls the events in Tiananmen Square, the issue is considered highly sensitive since serious problems relating to respect for human rights persist in China.
Indeed, economic liberalisation and the country's gradual integration into the international community are not being accompanied by similar political liberalisation and China still has a long way to go before reaching the human rights standards considered normal in our societies.
The Union's policy on the matter is under intense scrutiny and non-governmental organisations and public opinion expect tangible results.
Moreover, it should also be pointed out that Beijing has rejected the idea of making the lifting of the embargo dependent on tangible progress in human rights.
In any case, the necessary conditions for lifting the embargo are not yet in place in the European Union: this was clearly explained to our Chinese counterpart during the recent European Union-China Summit.
It is, moreover, clear that there are differing positions within the European Union on the subject and, in particular, on the stance to be taken in the face of repeated requests from the Chinese.
The matter will therefore have to be further discussed in depth in the future.
Decisive impetus has been supplied in this regard by the European Council of 12 December 2003, which called on the General Affairs and External Relations Council to review the question.
<d>
With regard to the incidents of last week, I can reassure colleagues that we have had very intensive contacts with the security services of the Member States, particularly in the light of Mr Titley's experience.
We have carried out a very thorough review of the security arrangements within our buildings.
A number of operational issues were raised in that review.
We have addressed these and shall continue to address them with a serious focus.
This issue was discussed at length last week in the Conference of Presidents and will be discussed at length again tonight in the Bureau.
It is appropriate that I should reassure you that this is being treated in the way you would expect.
It is also fitting that we know what our response is and ought to be, but that we keep it to ourselves.
On the final issue touched on in the course of these remarks on the incidents of last week, let us be clear that there is no justification for acts of terror against democratically-elected people – whatever the cause, wherever the place – including, in the light of last week, Members of this House.
No Member of this House should seek, directly or indirectly, to sustain the unsustainable and the unacceptable.
<d>
Mr President, the Commission welcomes the outcome of the conciliation process and is pleased that the co-legislators decided to more than double the recycling target by 2008.
The Commission also welcomes the fact that solutions could be found for two important and difficult issues.
The first is the procedure for adopting a deadline for accession states, and the second is the question of the consequences of the recent court judgment on energy recovery.
Concerning the deadline for the accession countries, a Commission proposal is under preparation.
The Commission thinks that the Parliament needs to be fully involved in this important matter, therefore this proposal will be based on codecision.
On the consequences of the Court judgment the Commission realises that not everybody is happy with the solution of transforming the recovery target into a target for recovery and incineration at waste incineration plants with energy recovery.
However, it would have been difficult to take Member States to court for having interpreted ‘ recovery ’ in the same way as most Member States and the Commission would have done until the judgment.
The view taken by the co-legislators may indeed avoid a period of legal uncertainty from which no one would have benefited.
However, this should not hide the fact that we need to solve the recovery issue.
This must be done, not only for packaging, but also for all waste.
Therefore the Commission thinks that we need to review the status of recovery in the waste framework directive.
The ongoing debate on the thematic strategy on waste prevention and recycling will be an important input to such a view.
The Commission would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Corbey, as well as all the Members who have contributed to ensuring the successful outcome of this important legislative process.

Mr President, Members of the Conference of Presidents, Members of the Bureau of Parliament, chairmen of the committees, Members of the European Parliament, ladies and gentlemen: people who visit Colombia very often say that it is a wonderful country, in complete contrast to the image portrayed by analysts and the media.
Others say that it is an illegitimate, authoritarian and elitist State.
With the strengthening of the State, our pluralist democracy has made the transition from formal and rhetorical guarantees to effective and genuine ones.
The vote proposed by the government and held on 25 October was discussed and approved by the Congress, its text was modified by the opposition and examined and reduced by the Constitutional Court.
Abstainers and opponents had every opportunity to express their views.
Nobody could complain of violation of their rights or government hostility.
The following day, the people elected 30 governors from amongst 133 candidates; 914 Mayors from amongst 3 441 candidates; 398 deputies from 373 lists comprising 2 723 candidates.
The number of candidates was twice that of previous elections.
In several cities and departments, candidates from parties other than the traditional parties won, from organisations arising from the former guerrilla groups, from, shall we say, leftist or opposition groupings.
In the campaign they carried out, the government s main concern ’ was to give them every possible guarantee.
And now that they are elected, the government has decided to work with them, within the Constitution, regardless of the political reasons they were elected, transparently, and above all, with the patriotic task of uniting Colombia in its diversity.
Mayors and governors elected by the people have been victims of pressure and murder from terrorists.
At the beginning of this government, 416 mayors were threatened by the guerrillas and 216 were not able to carry out their duties in the territory of their jurisdiction.
The work done on security means that the problem persists in just 14 places.
For more than a century Colombia discussed the popular election of Mayors, as a fundamental step towards extending democracy.
The terrorist guerrillas demanded it as a condition for peace.
It was approved in the 1980s.
But that is the paradox of terrorism: it is the murderer who destroys the local democracy it calls for.
Our State is made up of institutions which monitor one another and of the broad participation of public opinion, which means that the citizens are subject to the rule of law and not the whim of the authoritarian governor.
My government takes a democratic view of security, in order to protect all the citizens regardless of their ideas, of their economic situation, of whether they are employers or workers or whether or not they are supporters of the government.
Dealing with 30 000 terrorists is not easy.
We are aware that our challenge is to overcome the terrorist threat transparently, as a starting point for building national unity and sustainable democratic security, which seeks to restore law and order.
While terrorism is the great violator of human rights, the State and the security forces are devoted to upholding them.
Last year 76 864 members of the institutional forces were qualified in Human Rights.
In 2002 the Public Prosecutor received 231 complaints against the security forces for abuses of international humanitarian law.
The number was reduced to 160 in 2003.
The monitoring bodies, the justice system and the government share the determination to severely punish any proven violation of human rights.
Colombia feels gratitude and pride in the courage of its soldiers and policemen.
The sacrifice they have made in order to bring us peace has been immense: since August 2003, 277 soldiers and policemen have been killed by antipersonnel mines alone, and 854 have been injured, many of them permanently mutilated.
Our country is open to the vigilance of the international community.
At our request, we now have an office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.
Their recommendations are received with respect.
When the government believes they cannot be complied with, the issue is discussed frankly.
I recognise the role of human rights NGOs, I value the work of many of them, despite the fact that I express my disagreement with reports which do not correspond to the facts.
In almost 1 200 000 square kilometres, with more than 400 000 of jungle, for years the State has not been present, replaced by terrorist organisations.
We have proposed extending the institutional capacity to protect the citizens.
Of the country's 1 100 municipalities, in 170 there was no police presence.
Today there is a police presence in all of them, although we will not rest until the last of the urban centres is protected.
In 450 municipalities we have installed soldiers and marines, known as ‘ of My People ’, who carry out their military service in their place of residence.
The results are encouraging, and there is great hope that, following their active period within the security forces, we can count on them as leaders in compliance with the law, forever.
Between 2002 and 2003, murders were reduced by 20%, kidnappings by 26%, massacres by 33%, attacks on the population by 84%.
In January 2004 there were 51 kidnappings compared to 186 in January 2003, and murders were reduced by a further 17%.
The murder of teachers, trade unionists and journalists has reduced and, fortunately, the murderers in several cases are already in jail, as a result of our determination to eliminate impunity.
I would like to re-state our enthusiasm and commitment to providing protection with particular emphasis on teachers, trade unionists and journalists, because no democracy can allow them to be murdered.
Violent deaths of indigenous people, indigenous aid workers and environmentalists, cruelly persecuted by terrorist groups, have decreased as a result of State presence in the ancestral territories.
Internal displacement is one of our great tragedies resulting from terrorism.
During the last year it was reduced by 53% and 11 140 families have returned to their places of origin.
Although we have made some progress, the job has hardly begun.
What country can accept 2 200 kidnappings in one year?
We will only claim victory when the massacres and acts of terror are completely eradicated, because every one of them brings pain to the entire nation, such as the car bomb set off by the FARC in the Club El Nogal, exactly a year ago, killing 33 and injuring 173; or the rural worker from La Unión Peneya, who was burnt alive by terrorist guerrillas because he refused to abandon his home and swell the numbers of displaced people; or the peasant woman from Tibú, who lost her leg as a result of a mine while she was out walking with her five-year-old daughter.
The constitutional reform which introduces anti-terrorist laws was approved by Congress amidst national and international debate.
The powers given to security forces to capture, intercept and carry out raids in cases of terrorism were subject to the subsequent approval of a statutory law, and also to other guarantees such as the obligation to bring the case before the courts within 36 hours, the immediate dispatch of a report to the Public Prosecutor and periodic scrutiny by Congress.
The law is less stringent than those in force in many Western democracies.
I believe that the world must reconsider the idea that this type of power placed in the hands of governments jeopardises human rights, since these must be respected fully and in the same way by both the judiciary and the executive.
I classify violent groups as terrorists on the basis of the nature of their actions, the democratic context of Colombia, the comparable international legislation, the source of their resources and the results of their activities.
People who plant antipersonnel mines, kill children, take pleasure in their own cruelty and act treacherously can only be described as terrorists.
People who attack democracy, by means of violent action, while Colombia is determined to offer guarantees to all expressions of political thought, can only be described as terrorists.
People who for ideological or other reasons use or threaten violence are defined as terrorists under the legislation of many countries.
Likewise, anybody who behaves like that in Colombia can only be described as a terrorist.
People who fund violence through illegal drugs and kidnappings, destroying the dignity, freedom and ecology of the people, can only be described as terrorists.
People who use poverty and inequality as a way to justify violence and then cause more poverty and more inequality through the exercise of that violence, can only be described as terrorists.
I am not opposed to a negotiated solution, but it must not be mixed with terrorism.
An end to hostilities is a requirement, but disarmament and demobilisation require long timescales.
Colombia has had a generous tradition of negotiated solutions with armed groups.
My predecessor, President Andrés Pastrana, made a huge effort to negotiate with the FARC.
His good faith and patriotism were deceived in a cowardly manner by the FARC, which expanded their criminal empire while the nation waited and hoped for a peace agreement.
I have made democratic security a priority because that will make the armed groups appreciate the need to negotiate seriously, on pain of total annihilation by the institutions.
Nevertheless, efforts have been made to begin negotiations with them.
With the help of the Catholic Church, of Cuba, with the intervention of the Group of Friendly Nations and the Group of Facilitator Countries, we have sought dialogue with the ELN.
There have been no results so far despite our willingness.
They are afraid of taking steps towards peace without the permission of the FARC.
The Catholic Church offered to mediate with the illegal vigilantes and I decided to allow it to continue.
I accepted that the Peace Commissioner should begin dialogue when these organisations declared an end to hostilities.
It is time to update and monitor this ceasefire, with regard to which the support of the Organisation of American States is extremely useful, and this must quickly lead greater numbers of members of these groups to show a genuine desire for peace.
When the State and society is attacked violently the legal order is also attacked just as it is when it is claimed that they are being defended through appeals for violence and the action of vigilante groups.
We must recover the principle of exclusive institutional protection of citizens.
The demobilisation of vigilantes contributes to achieving this aim.
The government ’ s military action has been implacable against the vigilante sectors which have not respected the ceasefire.
This is demonstrated by the number of demobilisations, which increased by 85% in 2003 compared to 2002, and the number of those captured, which increased by 135% over the same period.
The draft law on alternative penalisation, which is being discussed widely, seeks to facilitate peace agreements, without impunity, in harmony with justice.
Although its negotiation coincides with the process which is being put forward with the self-defence groups, it is needed even more for the guerrilla forces, which has more members and a greater level of demobilisation during the current government.
In that law we must look at the past and anticipate the future.
The pardoning of horrific crimes in the past is unacceptable today and it would also be unacceptable if tomorrow the law we adopt is modified in accordance with a political predisposition towards other perpetrators of terrorism who want to negotiate.
During this period of government almost 4 500 members of armed groups have been demobilised, 68% of them members of the FARC guerrilla organisation.
They have been received with complete generosity and the State has made huge efforts to help them reintegrate into society.
This number exceeds what has been achieved in peace processes over past decades.
The FARC are holding more that 1 000 hostages, including congressmen, members of the security forces and the ex-presidential candidate Ingrid Betancur, who has both Colombian and French citizenship.
I understand the pain of their families and the international interest in a humanitarian agreement.
Initially I made an end to hostilities and the initiation of dialogue a condition.
My talks with the Church, the French Government, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, and the families of the victims, led me to accept the quest for an agreement on the basis of negotiations held under the auspices of the United Nations, the release of all hostages, and the commitment on the part of terrorists leaving prison not to return to offending, with effective guarantees, such as their residing in a country which respects the agreement.
Without the effective guarantees that they will not return to crime, the government cannot release terrorist guerrillas.
Otherwise, we would be disrespecting the sacrifices of the security forces, discouraging their actions and withering the popular spirit of respecting the law.
We would be opening the door to constant extortion against the State and society.
We must bear in mind that on the one hand there are respectable citizens kidnapped by terrorists while on the other there are terrorists who are in jail.
We must bear in mind that war is one thing but terrorism is quite another.
In war there are parties whose legitimacy is recognised for the purposes of humanitarian agreements, while with terrorism there is a murderer and a victim which is society, the rights and welfare of which we must protect through institutional arms.
The authority cannot therefore give up on the rescue of hostages, despite the cruelty of the criminal, as demonstrated by the murders of Gilberto Echeverri, Guillermo Gaviria, Doris Gil, Helmut Bickenback, Chikao Muramatsu, and many members of the security forces.
Murders of defenceless citizens by the FARC when they thought the authorities were present in the neighbourhood of the captivity.
No negotiation can be allowed to strengthen the murderer.
Colombia is a social democracy.
63% of the country ’ s budget, excluding debt repayments, is directed towards social protection, education and health, directly and by means of decentralisation.
Terrorism has increased poverty.
Building peace requires that we overcome that poverty.
The government is working on a plan known as ‘ The Seven Tools of Equity ’, which are: educational revolution, social protection, promoting economic solidarity, social management of the countryside, of public services, a country of owners and quality of urban life.
Primary and intermediate education coverage reached 86.3%; the State technical education service will achieve its four-year goal of increasing from 1 070 000 students per year to 4 000 000; the various child nutrition programmes benefit 5 000 000 children; the credit for small businesses increased last year by 57%.
We have many social problems, but we are completely determined to overcome them.
The economy grew last year by between 3.7% and 4%, when we expected 2%.
Last year the unemployment rate dropped by three points and the scourge of unemployment stood at 12.3%.
In Colombia inequality is not due to private enterprise but to the lack of private enterprise.
Organised private enterprise has top officials to contribute to solidarity with its workers and the rest of the population.
Our employers pay the majority of fiscal obligations, and the latest fiscal reforms have increased their taxes.
Terrorism has blocked the expansion of private enterprise and this has added poverty to the lack of business-like practices
We enthusiastically promote workers companies ’, cooperatives and the participation of users and workers in the provision of public services.
We believe in social capitalism.
In order to combat the concentration points of rural property in the hands of drug traffickers and terrorists combined, we approved a law to speed up the procedures for seizing assets.
Last year this rose from five definitive judgments to 61.
The European Union has given us extremely valuable support which I would like to thank you for.
The London Declaration commits us deeply.
It has been a great source of democratic commitment, a great sign of European support.
The funding of the Peace Laboratories is welcomed by the Community.
We need more cooperation in order to destroy drugs.
Without drugs there would be no terrorism.
This is not a time for blaming some people because they produce it and others because they consume it.
The problem is so great that all permissive countries end up being producer, trafficker and consumer.
It is time to destroy drugs.
Our rural workers who cultivate it feel deceived by the terrorists and that their dignity is violated.
They yearn for alternatives.
We now have 20 000 forest-guard families to look after the areas free of coca and supervise the recovery of the jungle.
Each receives around 2 000 dollars per year.
We need to increase this to 50 000 families.
Young Europeans must be aware that drugs have destroyed 1 700 000 hectares of tropical jungle in Colombia, right at the access to the Amazon basin, which is seriously threatened by this scourge.
We in the Andean Community are concerned that the European Union has not decided to negotiate a free trade agreement with our countries, when it has updated it with Mexico and Chile, and proposes to bring it forward with MERCOSUR.
The imperfections of Andean integration which are used as a reason not to negotiate that treaty would be overcome on the basis of the obligations imposed by an agreement with the European Union.
We are grateful for the extension of the General System of Preferences and we respectfully request that it be maintained until it is replaced with a permanent agreement.
I address this Parliament with profound respect, with gratitude for the interest you have shown and your constant assistance for Colombia.
I am aware that the solutions my government is seeking to my country s complex problems ’ are controversial.
I would repeat that I have faith in creative deliberation.
Deliberation is more constructive than absence.
Debate is more constructive than withdrawal.
Constructive polemic produces more than the abandonment of seats.
You are aware of my intransigence toward terrorism.
My generation has not seen a single day of peace.
The country we want for our children and future citizens must be a country of peace and equity.
Distinguished Members of the European Parliament, I would like to say to you once again that my love for democracy is profound.
<d>
Mr President, we are currently engaged in pursuing interim reform of the CAP.
I shall not reiterate arguments I adduced in the past.
Nonetheless, I would like to take this opportunity to restate my opposition to measures that would have a significant impact on the common agricultural policy.
Decoupling aid will result in reduced production.
That much is clear.
All economic activity in underprivileged areas or areas with natural disadvantages will suffer too.
A two-tier land market will emerge because some of the land will be entitled to aid and the rest will not.
This will fuel speculation.
It will be even more difficult for young farmers to start out in life.
Young farmers will require funds to purchase payment rights in addition to funds to purchase land.
All these developments will come at a critical stage in the hand over of agricultural holdings from one generation to another.
The situation of the economy in general is precarious too, and the prospects for jobs bleak.
There could be serious implications for the population of the areas in question.
The consequences will be most noticeable for crops in the disadvantaged areas or for crops involving the most variable costs in terms of intensity of labour.
This is very much the case for the crops under discussion today.
Cotton, tobacco and olive oil are all in this category.
I am aware of the mandate given by the Council of Ministers, although I do not endorse it.
I cannot do so because of the drastic consequences it would have for extensive sensitive areas.
Essentially, this policy is about using scant economic resources to attain certain objectives.
To date, resources were allocated to these crops with clear objectives in mind.
The question arises as to what the objectives of this proposal are.
The risks involved are abundantly clear, however.
Even the Commission itself has recognised them.
This proposal means abandoning a policy that had proved successful.
The current COM for olive oil has resulted in substantial improvements in terms of quality and consumer safety. It also stimulated economic activity in depressed areas.
Why should it be abandoned?
In the case of other cereal crops, the option of keeping a percentage of aid coupled to production has been retained.
The circumstances of these crops are very different from those of olive oil.
Surely similar arrangements for olive oil could be considered?
I would also like to mention the stance adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development of the European Parliament.
The only way of ensuring that what actually reaches the consumer is actually olive oil is to keep part of the aid coupled to production.
The fact that all this has coincided with the proposal to stop financing control agencies is giving rise to concern.
Even if the agencies survived, what instruments would they have at their disposal to guarantee the quality of the oil?
Honest undertakings and ones tempted to be dishonest can be found in any sphere of economic activity.
I suggest that only the dishonest ones stand to gain from this Commission proposal.
Accordingly, I have tabled a series of amendments aimed at keeping 25% of aid coupled to production.
I trust the House will support them.
<d>
As a follow-up to the Commission communication which addressed, amongst other matters, the management of mining waste, given the specific characteristics of mines and the considerable disparities between subsectors of the extractive industries, work was undertaken on re-assessing Community environmental policy, in light of recent mining accidents, for example at Baie Mare, in Romania, and at Aznacollar, in Spain.
Of course I support this proposal, because it sets minimum requirements for improving the management of waste from the extractive industries, including, to be specific, for the environmental and human risks related to waste processing and elimination operations.
Furthermore, the form of waste recovery that the proposal advocates is aimed at preserving resources, reducing the pressure that is exerted on the exploitation of natural resources.
The Directive s provisions ’ seek, therefore, to cover the sectors that present serious risks to the environment and to health or which present potential risks of serious accidents, paying particular attention, for this reason, to the structural aspects of an environmental policy which, as the European Union proposes, should be sustainable.
Lastly, I would emphasise the introduction of some important amendments aimed at upholding the interests of small quarries that have to meet the demands of the directive.
I voted in favour.
<d>
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to reiterate my congratulations to the rapporteur, Mrs Thors.
Congratulations are also due to Mr Turmes, draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.
I should like to thank both honourable Members for their work and contributions to the debate.
I certainly believe that what we are concerned with here is a major initiative.
It could have a real impact on the aim of decoupling growth from increased energy consumption.
Significant savings in energy consumption can be made.
I agree with the honourable Members who pointed out that presenting an overview of the whole process is the best way to avoid deluding ourselves.
After all, there is no point in economising in part of the process of creating a product or in part of its useful life if the end result is a negative overall balance.
A detailed list of the Commission s position ’ on the various amendments will be forwarded to the Presidency (1).
Nonetheless, I should like to say a few words on some of the issues raised and discussed in the course of the debate.
I shall deal first with the question of Council approval.
I would like to make it clear to the House that I had hoped this text would be agreed with the Council, and I did my best to ensure agreement, as this would have enabled the text to be adopted at first reading.
The fact is that when it came down to it, the Irish Presidency encountered serious obstacles to achieving our objective the first time round.
Nonetheless, I feel it is very likely that this text will be adopted at second reading, should it prove impossible to adopt it at first reading.
As many honourable Members have pointed out, the matter is urgent.
It is essential to put this new Community regulation in place once and for all.
In addition, comitology procedure must be launched.
The procedure needs to be sufficiently flexible to adapt to subsequent change and technological development.
It must also be able to provide an appropriate response on more specific matters.
On the subject of comitology and lack of control by Parliament, I should like to remind you, ladies and gentlemen, that we are party to global generic agreements concerning good legislation and the institutions ’ capacity to forge links between themselves.
I believe these agreements provide sufficient assurance that there will be no deviation or real difficulties regarding the implementation of these measures.
As to the legal basis, Parliament s Committee ’ on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has confirmed that Article 95 of the Treaty is the only appropriate legal basis for this proposal.
I endorse this view, and hope you will too.
These are the key issues I wished to mention.
I must emphasise the urgency of adopting this measure.
I very much hope that by the time we meet again in June, the Council s common position ’ will be as close as possible to the proposal put forward by Parliament itself.
Adoption of the text at second reading should then be fairly straightforward, always supposing it is not adopted at first reading.
I hope adoption will be possible as soon as the new Parliament assembles.
The text certainly needs to be adopted before the end of this year.
<d>
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is the start of the final budgetary procedure in plenary in the current legislature.
The composition of the House due to vote on this report tomorrow will not be the same as that of the House that will vote on final adoption of the 2005 budget in December, assuming that stage is reached.
I trust that at least my colleagues on the Committee on Budgets and I will be able to vote in December along with our new colleagues from the new Member States.
I would like to thank all colleagues and officials for the spirit of cooperation they have demonstrated towards me thus far.
An innovative step forward has been taken with regard to modernising the budgetary procedure.
Further to the debate on stock taking and the change to activity based budgeting, the European Parliament is doing away with the former budgetary guidelines. These are replaced by a resolution on the Annual Policy Strategy Report.
One objective is to render the legislative procedures more appropriate. It is also hoped to influence the drafting of the Commission ’ s preliminary draft budget.
We therefore urge the Commission to take account of our political and budgetary priorities when negotiating with the various Directorates-General.
We set out to draft a shorter resolution this year.
Unfortunately, I fear we have failed in our endeavour, as we did in previous years.
Nonetheless, I am delighted with my colleagues contributions ’.
I should like to take this opportunity of emphasising that the opinions of the other parliamentary committees will be taken into account at first reading of the budget.
Commissioner, this draft 2005 budget is characterised from the outset by a special feature.
I refer to the budgetary restriction affecting categories 3, 4, and 5.
This budgetary limit will affect many programmes and will call for a particular effort to improve the distribution of appropriations between ongoing functions and new priorities.
We believe that the new needs will require additional resources.
Concerning agriculture, we call on the Commission to make a statement on the pilot projects and on the initiatives launched in the 2004 budget.
With regard to the Structural Funds, we point to the improved implementation of appropriations in 2003, despite retaining a very high RAL.
Your rapporteur intends to set the final figure for appropriations by reference to Member States forecasts ’.
Turning to internal policies, the European Parliament is concerned about meeting the mid-term objectives set at Lisbon.
We therefore request that budgetary resources be focused on the key actions in 2005.
Special attention will be paid to small- and medium-sized enterprises, as they are the drivers of growth and employment.
Parliament is also concerned about implementation of communication and information policy.
The new Financial Regulation must not hinder the development of the latter.
This budget s main aim ’ will be the consolidation of the European area of freedom, security and justice.
It will pay particular attention to the common immigration policy and to speeding up implementation of the integrated Schengen and VIS Project systems.
Substantial budgetary resources will be required in both cases. Parliament must deal quickly with these priorities, however, if it is to be seen to respond to concerns expressed by European citizens.
We shall stand shoulder to shoulder with you on this, Commissioner.
We shall also respond appropriately to the challenge posed by terrorism, particularly in the wake of the terrible attacks perpetrated in Madrid on 11 March.
All our efforts to ensure no such outrage can ever take place in Europe again will be dedicated to the victims.
This is why we shall endorse the pilot project for aid to the victims of terrorism. We shall also support strengthening Europol and Eurojust.
In addition, we are in favour of your directive on compensation for victims of crime. We shall support similar initiatives brought before the House also.
To summarise, in the case of the fight against terrorism, the House will go beyond supporting the Council and the Commission. It will actually try to take the lead.
With regard to external affairs, Parliament will become ever more involved in the reconstruction of Iraq and the consolidation of democracy in Afghanistan. The traditional priority areas for the House will not be neglected either.
New additions for this year are the neighbourhood policy, the creation of a European diplomatic service and of a European external action service.
The general principle applied throughout will be that new external needs must be financed with new resources so as not to detract from our traditional priorities.
Lastly, we have taken note of the 700 posts you request from us, Commissioner. We very much hope that you will in any case try to arrange some redeployment.
I shall conclude by saying that we will be very vigilant as far as the various agencies are concerned.
We shall ask them to provide a mid-term programme. The Commission should be able to include this in the draft preliminary budget in May on the development of these agencies.
<d>
Mr President, Commissioner Schreyer has done a good job, and she well deserves the respect of this House.
I think we would be able to do another five years worth ’ of work together, were it not for the reshuffling of the Commission s membership ’, something that I very much regret.
You have left us a little legacy in the form of your speech on the scope and structure of the future Budget.
In essence I agree with you, and I am very grateful for the way in which you contradicted your own country s ’ government ’ s ideas about a shrinking budget.
If new policies are moved to the European level, money for them cannot be refused.
You said – and here I must be cautious – that the agricultural budget is substantial.
It is, but we must resist the tendency to use this Budget as a quarry for the new tasks that are to come.
What we want is a change of direction, and you talked about the Lisbon targets and economic development.
I see rural areas as part of this too.
You talk about research, education and innovation; they are needed in rural areas too.
Let me remind you that, when the EU was enlarged, a proposal of this House s Committee ’ on Agriculture was adopted to grant the funds collected for the pro-hectare bonuses as structural aid for rural areas.
Nothing has been done about that, and I think we will have a repeat of this argument when, in future, Turkey ’ s accession is on the agenda.
It is important that we invest in our own rural areas, where money gains added value, and the added value should remain in those countries.
It might be said that this often makes more sense than investing in certain major industrial projects.
I believe that we must – and will take – account of this in the structure of budgets in medium-term financial planning.
I hope that the House agrees with me in this.
It is unfortunate that our work together is coming to an end.
As a result of the redeployment of the mandatory funds, we have rather more responsibility for the agricultural budget.
I hope that we can bring about change in line with what Parliament wants.
Many thanks for your efforts, Commissioner Schreyer.
<d>
Mr President, Cuba is clearly a very sensitive, as well as a very complex, subject, and I do of course agree with those who say that the European Union, and this Parliament in particular, should work for more democracy and respect for human rights across the world, and that is also true of Cuba.
The fundamental question we should be asking ourselves, though, is how we can best achieve this, how we can best help the Cuban people.
Is it by rejecting dialogue with the Cuban authorities, and thus with a large majority of civil society?
I do not think so.
Yet that, today, is the reality of the situation on the ground.
Since the channels of communication with the Europeans have been closed, the EU s common position ’ has produced no satisfactory results.
An assessment is therefore in order, provided it is a rational one, and the common position may need to be adapted.
Indeed, along with a few other MEPs, I recently visited Cuba, and we were able to witness for ourselves a number of positive developments concerning education, for example, or health care.
We ought to tell them this and we also ought to tell them that there are many aspects in Cuba we do not like at all, but at least we ought to strike up a dialogue, like we do with other countries including China, Saudi Arabia or Vietnam.
<d>
. Mr President –, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has adopted a position with regard to the Constitution, of which I shall highlight the following salient points: we welcome the fact that the implementation of the three pillars of sustainable development is among the Union s objectives ’ and that environmental integration and a high level of protection for human beings have been recognised.
It is a pity that the third part relating to the Union s policies ’ and functioning does not tally with the principle of sustainable development, within the scope of the policies on agriculture, cohesion, transport and trade.
Certain environmental measures – such as those relating to tax, town planning, quantitative water management and land use – could be subject to the ordinary legislative procedure, but instead are still adopted unanimously by the Council.
We welcome the adoption of measures aimed at attaining high standards of quality and safety of medicines and medical devices.
Measures relating to surveillance and early warning systems in the fight against serious cross-border health threats are also a step in the right direction.
Such measures form part of the EU ’ s shared powers and are therefore subject to the ordinary legislative procedure.
We welcome the introduction of a chapter on democratic life in the Union, and the principle whereby these positions must be taken as transparently as possible and in the manner that is closest to the citizens.
Furthermore, we should like to highlight the importance of the Community institutions ’ responsibility towards the public, and public access to the courts and other relevant organisations, not least in the field of the environment.
Personally, Mr President, I feel that the next step is to discover how the public will take to the new constitutional structure; how this Constitution, which has been created in a somewhat top-down fashion, will be received and experienced from the bottom upwards; and how the principle of equality between States and the Community method will be strictly guaranteed in practice.
Only history will be able to tell us.
<d>
As we commemorate the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp, we remember and condemn the horrific tragedy of the Holocaust.
We cannot, and must not, forget this tragedy, which is one of the most shameful and painful chapters in our continent s history ’.
Let it serve as a lesson to all of us for the future, so that we can combat the extremes that lead to intolerance, discrimination and racism.
I support the idea that the 27th should become the day on which, throughout Europe, we remember the Holocaust and pay tribute to its victims.
I am concerned at the growing signs of anti-Semitism and racism, and at the rise of extremist and xenophobic parties.
It is up to the EU and the international community as a whole, fully and effectively to promote and protect civil and fundamental rights in the Union and in the world.
The EU must remain faithful to the values that form part of its shared heritage, must strive to safeguard the principles of tolerance and non-discrimination and must promote social, economic and political integration.
It is crucial that we resume discussions on the draft framework decision on racism and xenophobia, because we will only be able to combat these phenomena effectively and consistently throughout EU territory if we adopt an integrated approach that involves both preventative and punitive measures.
<d>
The setting up of a Community institution to ensure a certain level of coordination in the work of national fisheries inspectors is a useful initiative.
What is crucial, however, is the scope of the competences of the institution that is set up, and its mandate.
I cannot vote in favour of the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a Community Fisheries Control Agency.
Control of such matters falls under the jurisdiction of the Member States, both practically and in legal terms, and the proposal for a regulation violates the equilibrium between the institutions.
Another aspect of the common fisheries policy is the protection of aquatic resources.
The Lisbon strategy states that sustainable development entails paying attention to both the ecological and social factors of this development.
By protecting aquatic resources, we also protect the people who make their living from these waters.
We should review overly ambitious conservation plans that only allow for short periods for the renewal of fish stocks, as is in the case with the cod stocks in the Eastern Baltic.
The period that has been agreed on gives rise to unacceptable social tensions.
<d>
Mr President, as the President of this House has now for the third time in succession prevented me from stating my position in a one-minute speech, I would like to give very brief consideration to an issue that I have been wanting to address for a long time.
At this very moment this House s bureau ’ is convening, and item 8 on the agenda for its meeting is a highly problematic one. They are planning an assault on the freedom of the press.
In a House that claims to the outside world that it defends transparency, its bureau, without negotiating with the Members and without publicising it in any way, intends to enact rules that are a mockery of press freedom and are intended to permit nothing but obsequious and uncritical reporting.
I just want to point that out to the public, and I have previously asked the President to prevent this happening.
The same can be said of item 7 on the meeting s agenda ’.
There is a direct connection between all this and the topic we are discussing now: the annual report of an EU institution, in this instance that of the European Investment Bank.
We have seen in past years that its lack of transparency made possible the practice of a very large number of things that have to be done away with.
I very much welcome paragraph 21 of this report, which gives voice to concern about the potential conflicts of interest among the EIB s management ’, to which there have been repeated references in the press.
I note with interest that an amendment has already been tabled to remove this.
I still have a very clear recollection of the reports on this subject last summer, for example in the 19 August issue of the.
I can see no evidence of these conflicts of interest having been done away with, nor of there being any transparency about them, and I do not think that we can, at this early stage, be so generous with our praise of the Investment Bank.
Generally important though I regard the Bank as being, we can see that the absence of transparency excludes the possibility of trust and democracy, in this House as much as in the EIB.
<d>
– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, if I were asked for the two main reasons why I consider the convergence in the positions of the Council Presidency, the Commission and Parliament that we see today to be important, I would reply that my first reason is that the social and environmental aspects of development are being sincerely acknowledged not as constraints and obstacles but as factors in our competitiveness.
My second reason is that we all agree that in order to properly relaunch the Lisbon Strategy it is essential to create a sense of ownership of the strategy that filters down to local levels, so that responsibility lies first and foremost with national governments and parliaments as well as with the public.
I agree wholeheartedly on this point, which I hope will be transformed into tangible measures in the European Council.
This time, however, I must disagree with what Mrs Frassoni said in her speech. Among her reasons for rejecting the proposal for a resolution – which I, on the other hand, support – she mentioned the fact that one of the paragraphs in the resolution called the REACH regulation into question.
Madam President, you know very well how much I value that regulation and I would never risk jeopardising it by supporting the proposal for a resolution.
I should, however, like to call on my fellow Members not to regard the regulation as a symbol of good or evil any longer, as polarisation of that kind implies that in the end there will be winners and losers.
I believe, instead, that reaching agreement on that regulation would be a victory for us all.
<d>
– Parliament has just passed a resolution calling for the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon.
That is a positive step, but it does not go far enough.
The re-establishment of Lebanese independence also requires that those Lebanese who were forced to leave their country should be able to return and that all political prisoners, prominent among whom is Samir Geagea, should be set free.
However, the majority of Members who voted in favour of a text defending the sovereignty of Lebanon are the same ones who are striving to dismantle the sovereignty of our own nations within the Europe of Brussels; a Europe without borders, open to immigration from anywhere in the world.
Lebanon lost its sovereignty as a result of massive immigration.
The arrival, in the early 1970s, of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians shattered the demographic equilibrium between Moslems and Christians – to the detriment of the latter, who became a minority in their own country.
The resulting civil war served as a pretext for Syria to occupy Lebanon and put an end to its sovereignty.
Today, the presence of 500 000 Syrian immigrants is a serious obstacle to the restoration of independence to the country.
The disaster of Lebanon is proof: woe betide a country which loses its identity and sovereignty.
<d>
– President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to point out that I am speaking in my capacity as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets on the issue of the Structural Funds.
In the time allocated to me, there is so much to say that I have decided to select a number of points which, with the budgetary orthodoxy of this Parliament, apply to all opinions and are relevant to the various reports concerned, both that of my colleague Mr Andria on the Cohesion Fund, and those on the ERDF, ESF and European Fisheries Fund, as well as the general opinion of our fellow Member Mr Hatzidakis on the Regulation laying down general provisions.
I also thank all my fellow Members for the vast amount of work they have undertaken.
The challenges facing Europe are now, more than ever, of critical importance for the development of the European Union ’ s future competitiveness, for which the Structural Funds represent not only the indispensable financial instruments but also, today, in the current Europe of 25, which we are now building – in this Enlarged Europe – the spearhead for the Union s budgetary objectives ’ and the essential vector for our ambitions for Europe.
I shall not refer again to the substantial work done by the Committee on Budgets or to that of the Parliamentary Temporary Committee on the Financial Perspectives.
While Europe is experiencing an unprecedented crisis, Parliament has assumed its responsibilities by adopting, in June, the Böge report on the budgetary means of the enlarged Union 2007-2013.
It is true that, during the preparatory discussion on the Structural Funds, based on the Commission s proposal ’ which focused on the three objectives of convergence, regional competitiveness and employment, and European territorial cooperation, we had no clear indication of the figures contained in the budget.
Today, the situation remains complex, not to say grotesque, to use the words of some of our fellow citizens: we are asked to express a view on the Structural Funds while still being unaware of the final amounts to be allocated to them if – as I and the vast majority of our colleagues hope – we manage to reach a rapid agreement on the financial perspectives.
In connection with two or three key matters, I should therefore just like to stress a few principles based on common sense and simple budgetary orthodoxy, which will enhance the role of the European Parliament as a budgetary authority.
The first is that once these financial perspectives have been approved, the Commission will, firstly, confirm the amounts indicated in the proposal for a regulation or, if applicable and necessary, submit the amended amounts for approval by the European Parliament and the Council to ensure they fall within the ceilings, as the Committee on Budgets is constantly pointing out that they should.
The second point, already referred to on many occasions, debated at length and regularly stressed in Parliament s Committee ’ on Budgets, is to draw attention to the positive results of applying the N + 2 rule and to propose that it should be retained as a matter of principle.
The Regulation laying down General Provisions and the Regulation on the Cohesion Fund stipulate that this N + 2 rule should apply to the Cohesion Fund.
I would remind members that the aim of this rule is to encourage the beneficiary Member States to use the funds committed without delay, obliging them to use a degree of discipline in the preparation and financial management of projects.
However, aware of the potential difficulties for the new Member States in making rapid use of the Structural Funds, we, and, in particular, the rapporteur Mr Andria obtained, with great difficulty and after long discussions, a compromise whereby the N + 2 rule would be relaxed in response to the requests from our new colleagues and should become sufficiently flexible to enable projects to be started and executed rapidly.
The time allowed under the N + 2 rule will start to run on day 1 of the project s implementation ’, not on the first day of scheduling by the Commission, thereby creating the flexibility that will help us in achieving our aims.
Lastly, I shall not go back over the issue of non-refundable VAT, on which we wholeheartedly uphold the position of Commissioner Hübner.
To conclude, the Committee on Budgets will ensure that its different positions adopted by Parliament are defended.
It is, of course, ready to begin negotiations without delay with the Council and Commission on the financial perspectives, to which it is strongly committed, believing that, contrary to the statements of Jack Straw reported in Le Figaro on 30 June, it would be extremely serious if we were unable to reach agreement before the end of this year.
If we delayed in reaching agreement, we must realise that the delay in implementing the policies would have serious economic and social consequences for our fellow Europeans.
However, despite this, it is important to be clear on one point: Parliament will not accept a bad agreement, and we shall have no hesitation in rejecting it.
<d>
Mr President, thanks are due to all the rapporteurs for the open and inclusive manner in which they have handled the dossiers and for the extent of the consensus they have built.
My own thanks are particularly due to Mr Hatzidakis for supporting the ALDE amendments to his own report.
I speak specifically, however, of the Casa report; here we wish to introduce references to an ecosystem-based approach to management, to Regional Advisory Councils and to improved disclosure on financial control structures.
I ask colleagues to vote in favour of them.
On a personal note, whilst I believe that there is much to commend already in the report, there are certain aspects that, like the Commissioner, I cannot support.
Resources allocated to the fund are limited; there are many needs to be met.
The inclusion of safety improvements and of improvements to quality conditions on board vessels, and the inclusion of measures to make vessels more environmentally friendly may be acceptable, particularly for the small-scale coastal sector.
However, I am strongly opposed, both in principle and as regards the practical effects, to using European taxpayers ’ money for wider fleet renewal.
This is simply an attempt to turn the clock back.
More generally – and I turn to the President-in-Office – I would like to echo colleagues from across the political groups and urge the Council to take very seriously Parliament ’ s recommendations on the financial perspectives and on structural funding as found in the Berger and Hatzidakis reports.
Otherwise, I fear serious adverse effects for both economic regeneration and social inclusion.
I also believe very strongly that EU funding should be available to areas in need wherever in the Union they happen to be located.
In this light, I wish the UK well in its Presidency, hoping that it will include a speedy on the financial perspectives.
When its Prime Minister spoke recently to this House, he referred to a union ‘ of values, of solidarity between nations and people ’.
May this understanding above all inform the debate.
<d>
Madam President, I will be brief, even though the project is worth discussing further.
I would like to thank Parliament for the support it is giving to this great programme.
It is true that the financial perspectives will have to be discussed but, in any event, I think that we must give priority to the billion intended for the Galileo programme.
The Galileo programme, as Mrs De Veyrac has just said, confirms the European Union ’ s true independence, and will make possible a number of applications.
Clearly, these applications must be within the reach of as many people as possible and will provide our small and medium-sized enterprises with many new opportunities.
There is no doubt that we need to focus on providing the human resources to make full use of the new opportunities provided by this programme.
I can well understand that Parliament particularly wishes to be involved in this programme.
In conclusion, I would like to thank Mrs Barsi-Pataky for her report to which you have responded.
It is a comprehensive and high-quality report.
I would also like to thank your Committee on Transport and Tourism and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for their support for the European Commission s proposal ’.
Of course, I support Parliament s concern ’ to feel fully responsible for the implementation of this project, which will be developed within the framework of a public-private partnership in which businesses will have a full part to play.
It has just been said that there were no private businesses involved in the development phase.
This is true in the development phase, but during the deployment and commercial operating phases it will be European businesses that, in the context of synergies, will carry this project; and that is the interesting aspect of all this.
The Supervisory Authority will, of course, ensure that the objectives pursued by the European Union are achieved.
Mrs Barsi-Pataky s report ’ goes in the direction wanted by the Commission, which can accept all the amendments proposed by the rapporteur, with the exception of Amendments 13 and 25. I am not going to respond to all the points raised.
Most of the amendments significantly improve the text and make a positive contribution to the programme.
Amendments 9, 10, 20 and 21 specify that the budgetary authority will be asked to give its approval in cases where financial guarantees or commitments arising from the programme exceed the budgetary allocation provided.
I give my approval.
I would also remind you that the Commission has promised that the future concession contract will provide for repayment of public financial contributions if the profit earned by the concession holder passes a certain threshold.
It therefore accepts Amendments 11 and 22, which provide for a profit-sharing mechanism, while specifying that the Community contribution will not automatically be repayed in full, but that repayment will depend on the profit earned by the concession holder.
With regard to the EUR 1 billion, I would stress that it is the result of a precise assessment of the costs of the programme and of the desire to get strong financial involvement from the private sector.
However, the Commission accepts the indicative inclusion of that figure at this stage by means of Amendment 19, while the discussions on the new financial perspectives are underway.
In contrast, the Commission cannot accept Amendments 13 and 25, giving Parliament observer status on the Administrative Board of the Supervisory Authority.
It would appear difficult for Parliament, which is the main budgetary control body for the Community as a whole, to both exercise this control and sit, even simply as an observer, on the administrative board of a body over which it has control.
I would add that there is currently no precedent for this in the other Community agencies.
The experts appointed by Parliament within some of these agencies are simply experts appointed for their qualifications and do not represent Parliament as an institution.
I think that Parliament must retain its power of control and must in no way be linked by its presence, even as an observer, on the administrative board.
I can assure you that the Commission is keen to provide the European Parliament with all the necessary information, including, as some have mentioned, with regard to the protection of our patents and of the most sensitive technologies.
That is why I hope that we will clearly confine ourselves to our mutual responsibilities and that Parliament will fully assume its responsibility for control.
I think that, for this reason, it is preferable not to retain Amendments 13 and 25, the spirit of which I well understand but which do not seem to follow the spirit of our institutions.
In conclusion, I am delighted at Parliament s work ’.
I am convinced that the final point, based on a general interinstitutional approach, will in no way diminish the importance of Parliament s role ’ and will not hinder the rapid and positive progress of the codecision procedure.
Thank you, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, for originating this great project that, we hope, will give the young generation a very positive and dynamic image of Europe.
I thank you and I hope that Parliament will support this great project by a large majority.

Mr President, Solidarity was an extraordinary experiment involving a community that developed on the basis of common values and confidence in freedom.
In August 1980 Polish workers demanded freedom of the press, freedom of religious belief and above all freedom to set up free trade unions and an end to persecution for reasons of conviction.
Millions of Poles said ‘ no to Communism ’, and this was the beginning of the end of the Communist dictatorship.
We called on the nations of Eastern Europe to engage in the struggle for civil liberties, which involved building a civil society.
We did so with determination and strong in the belief that freedom can be won in spite of all overtly political restrictions.
Millions of individuals committed themselves in solidarity to the life of their own country, a country that was free for 16 months until 13 December, when General Jaruzelski s Communist dictatorship ’ struck against this movement with a.
It was impossible to stifle or break our spirit, however, and we continued to live as free people.
Communism was mortally wounded at the Gdansk shipyard in August 1980, and received its nine years later in 1989.
We were helped in our struggle by other European nations.
France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom all supported us.
This gave us courage and a belief in our own strength, and I should like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to those who stood by us at that time.
It was thanks to you that we survived, strong in the knowledge that Europe was thinking of us and that we had not been forgotten.
To what extent can the ideals of solidarity move hearts and consciences today?
Nowadays, reflecting about Solidarity means reflecting about the nature of Europe.
Europe is more than an economy and a market.
It also stands for the values that make the European Community great.
Europe is a family of nations built on a Christian heritage.
Solidarity was founded on Christian principles and it strove to reawaken the best of human values in people. I refer to taking responsibility for each other, and being prepared to help those in need.
The Solidarity ethic could contribute to the creation of a contemporary vision of Europe that would awaken the interest of the world.
Reflecting about Solidarity nowadays also means reflecting about how to counter national egoism amongst the 25 Member States of the Union.
I am confident that this can be achieved.
I believe in a European Union imbued with solidarity, a Union that is capable of being competitive, but which is simultaneously capable of demonstrating solidarity with the small and the weak.
I believe in a Union that will hold high the banner of Solidarity and freedom, and be an inspiration to those who lack them.
<d>
Mr President, the United Nations evolved from various initiatives to bring the countries of the world together to promote true peace through the recognition of the dignity and worth of the human person and the value of the community local, national, and global – – in protecting the person.
In many ways over 60-plus years the UN has accomplished this vital mandate.
However, in recent decades there has been increasing criticism of the way the UN does business, the way it spends its money and the type of results it is getting or not getting.
The Millennium challenge is enormous and it will take a functional UN to meet it.
Reform is nothing to be ashamed of.
Even the tidiest house needs a spring-clean.
Every organisation needs to step back and review its methods.
I think the example of UNICEF is a good place to start in understanding the desperate and urgent need to reform the UN.
Jim Grant led and largely created UNICEF, the UN response to children, until he died in 1995.
UNICEF justifiably earned the respect of countries and agencies everywhere for its programmes of oral rehydration, breastfeeding promotion, and primary education.
UNICEF was in touch with the real needs of real children.
Over the ten years since Mr Grant's death, UNICEF seemed to become a vehicle not for promoting children, but a political agenda focused on women's rights, which was not the appropriate place: it was a children's agency.
Ms Bellamy, who directed UNICEF after Mr Grant, was forced to resign last year.
Although criticism was building over nine years of her tenure, the UN structures as they have evolved did not allow any internal investigation of UNICEF.
Only from the outside did an accumulation of critics and a growing scandal about the neglect of children's programmes eventually force her resignation.
Last year, amidst the final crescendo, publications such as were reporting that UNICEF's failure to develop a coherent strategy for child survival and its shortcomings were contributing to 10 million child deaths per year.
For an organisation to tolerate this, such a publicly known problem, shows it needs reform.
There is no disgrace in reform.
No, there is only disgrace in resisting reform where it is needed.
Success will come when we realise that the UN is an ideal that needs to be fostered and that we need an efficient organisation that can serve these ideals.

. – The resolution by the summit on 60 years of the UN bears the stamp of the new imperialist order, partially overturns the founding principles of the UN and creates preconditions for its being led by the USA and other imperialist powers.
Despite the objections and certain oppositions expressed, the basic uniform strategy of imperialism has been passed, especially in sections ΙΙΙ and ΙV; the strategy which attempts to legalise its aggressive and barbaric policy.
In the name of peace and collective security, changes are being made which relate to the use of strategic force by the UN and which indirectly bring ΝΑΤΟ and its rapid intervention forces into its operation.
A new intervention mechanism is being created entitled 'Peace-Building Commission', which includes a military corps, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (see Iraq).
At the same time, references are made to numerous issues which might be pretexts for intervention.
The proposals of the USA and other imperialists have been adopted to abolish the Human Rights Commission and set up a council and create a Democracy Fund which will be used to consolidate imperialist rule.
We voted against the joint resolution, noting that everyone who signed it has huge political responsibility in misleading the people as to the future of the UN and, at the same time, accepting the imperialist barbarism which needs to be overturned.
<d>
This conflict has cost 12 000 lives over the last decade, many of them civilians from among the most vulnerable sections of the population.
Amnesty International has reported that tens of thousands of children are abducted from schools by Maoist fighters to attend so-called political education and some, of course, are recruited as child soldiers.
The security forces are also guilty of violations of children's rights.
The extrajudicial killings of young people and others must stop.
All abuses by the security forces must be properly investigated.
All political prisoners must be released or tried under due process of law.
I welcome the Maoist ceasefire and I hope there will be an indefinite extension to this, but the King must reciprocate and he must also engage in constructive talks.
We in the EU must also play our part.
I call on the Council and the Member States to continue the suspension of military aid and call for all aid to be monitored and for certain sanctions to be imposed.
This really is to put pressure on the King and the government to restore democracy in Nepal.
It is long overdue.
<d>
– Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner: it is nice that she is introducing the draft to Parliament after the press is already familiar with it.
The enhancement of European content will meet with ample support, and two readings will give us sufficient time to then discuss this in detail.
Variety is Europe ’ s strength – we cannot compete with the US market there, nor do we want to but – it is of course also its weakness.
In my opinion, we cannot have product placement in films in the same way as the US.
After all, the market always determines the way products are represented in films.
There are no objections to a person driving a car, but when it comes to a situation where product placement is only available to those with the fattest wallets, something has gone wrong.
We also agree that advertising has no place in children ’ s programmes.
It is only the boundaries that are blurred; that much is clear.
Where should the boundaries be drawn?
I think that, once the door is opened to this, it will no longer be possible to contain it.
Therefore, there will be very great resistance to product placement and the blurred boundaries.
We shall have to discuss that further at the two readings.
<d>
– As the previous speeches have shown, this proposal for a directive has caused huge controversy, which has extended way beyond this Chamber, covering many port operators and most workers in the sector.
As regards the latter, I should like to state that we understand their protest but do not accept their violent methods.
That said, the two committees called upon to give their opinions both declared their opposition to the proposal for a directive, thereby further securing its political fate.
The importance of the port sector, Mr President, needs no added emphasis.
We all know that almost all external trade in the EU is conducted through its ports and that the ports employ some 350 000 people directly, not to mention those employed indirectly in the sector.
What is more, techniques for moving cargo and equipment are constantly evolving and this requires constant investment and renewal.
The questions that arise are therefore the following:
Is the proposal for a directive conducive to investment, competition and access to the market?
Does it respect the rights acquired as regards current operators?
Does it violate the principle of subsidiarity?
Is it fair as regards compensation in the event of replacing providers?
Does it affect the labour market and the social rights of workers in the sector?
In a word, does it achieve the objectives of greater efficiency, better competition, more internal market and better services?
Mr Jarzembowski sought to find even-handed answers to these questions, and I therefore wish to congratulate him.
It does strike me, however, that this proposal needs to be looked at again, in light of the conditions under which it has been presented by the Commission.
What is needed is a political strategy which genuinely stimulates the development of Europe s ports ’, as the rapporteur himself points out and amends, which takes account of the current state of affairs in the market and which involves all interested parties, naturally including Parliament.
It is for you, Commissioner, to provide the answer.
As far as we are concerned, it will obviously be much easier to make a decision in line with the stated objectives.
<d>
– Mr President, there is a particular need for the full and integrated application of the Convention in all the Member States.
Its importance is decisive for further progress with environmental policy.
We need to place particular emphasis on the need for the integrated provision of electronically digitised information, as this will provide the basis for the proper implementation of public participation in all environmental control and awareness-raising procedures.
This will quickly smooth out the problems of bureaucracy which have to date been the basic brake on all similar endeavours.
Finally, it is most important that there should be a direct and intense response from the public sector to all aspects of the report and the proposed actions, because in numerous states the public sector is also the provider of most of the environmental information.
The Korhola report, which carefully and cautiously addresses the complicated points of such a venture must, as far as non-governmental organisations are concerned, be open to these questions and not only strict or unfair towards them.
To close, I believe that an important job has been done and I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on her efforts.
<d>
Mr President, in the past few days and in fact, in general, during the discussion of this directive, the question of whether it is really necessary to prescribe standards for bathing water at European level has been put to me on a regular basis.
Is this not a classic example of a matter that could be dealt with at Member State level?
I am aware of the fact that Members belonging to the Dutch Social Democrats, who are sadly not here at the moment, even referred to it in a report as a disgraceful directive for swimming pool water.
Well, it is not a directive for swimming pools, let alone a directive for bath water.
It deals, of course, with coastal waters and lakes.
The question has been raised as to whether European action in this field adds any value.
Parliament did not have any doubts about this when the House debated this very point at first reading.
What is more important though, is that the Member States, and especially the Member States, felt that a directive was needed.
If that is what they want, that is what they should get, but I do believe that it should be a serious directive rather than one that allows for more exceptions than anything else.
In any event, after more than 12 years of discussion, a compromise has been struck – albeit with difficulty – between the Council and Parliament, which I assume will be translated into legislation tomorrow.
The new directive provides for cleaner bathing water along beaches and lakes in Europe, better information for bathers and less red tape for local authorities.
Across the whole of the European Union, more than 80% of bathing water locations already meet the stricter standards and in a number of Member States, even more than 90% of the swimming locations comply with them.
At present, some 12% of bathers annually suffer from nausea, from stomach infections, rashes, tightness of the chest or eye or ear infections.
The effect of the new directive is to tighten up health standards, as a result of which only 8% of bathers are expected to contract an illness.
From 2015, bathers will also be informed of the current bathing water quality at their bathing locations by means of symbols that will be identical across Europe.
At the moment, bathers can only access the quality that pertains to the previous year with some difficulty and only on the Internet.
What appeals to me is that before long, I will be able to see for myself what the quality of the water is on the spot, because I do not know about you, but I only take my laptop to the beach on very rare occasions.
Instead of 19 parameters, Member States will only need to measure 2 parameters, and that is an example of how the red tape will be cut when water is measured.
For a long time, the European Parliament and the governments were at loggerheads over the question of how strict the standards should be and how high the associated costs for the Member States.
We have reached a compromise that is satisfactory for all parties, and I think that in this respect, whilst the British Presidency deserves a compliment, it is the Commission – and you, Commissioner, in particular – who have been instrumental in bringing this compromise about.
I should also like to thank many of the shadow rapporteurs for their cooperation in this respect.
Bathing water will not only be cleaner, it will be cleaner, the costs will be manageable and deregulation is underway.
In conclusion, I am interested to hear what comments the Commission will have to make on the article that is soon to appear in the scientific magazine Environmental Health Perspectives ‘ ’, written by Mr Albrecht Wiedenmann and which carries the rather complex English title Concentration responsive effects ‘ with no observed adverse effect levels ’, abbreviated to NOAELS.
I cannot quite describe the term myself, but I am sure that you can.
I am at any rate interested to see if the Commission will also use this study in its 2008 assessment report, because it contains quite a few terse comments about the directive as we are about to adopt it.
I would add, though, time for incorporating it is rapidly running out.
I will be delighted when the directive will actually be adopted tomorrow.
I think it is a success for all of us, including myself, even though I am not exactly a keen swimmer.
I only go in if I have no other choice.
After 2015, I will be at least happier to take a dip.
I hope, Commissioner, that I will be able to do so without any concerns in your Member State too.
<d>
The next item is the joint debate on the common foreign and security policy on the following points:
– the Statement by the High Representative for the common foreign and security policy on the common foreign policy perspectives for 2006; and
– the report by Elmar Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the annual report from the Council to the European Parliament on the main aspects and basic choices of the CFSP, including the financial implications for the general budget of the European Union 2004 – (2005 / 2134 (INI)) (A6-0389 / 2005).
Before the speakers take the floor, I would like to thank Mrs De Keyser, chief European Union observer at the Palestinian elections, and Mr McMillan-Scott, who led our delegation of 27 parliamentary observers, for the work they have done.
We will no doubt have the opportunity to hear what they have to say during the debate, but at this point I would like to stress the important role played by our Members in terms of providing an objective view of the vitality of the electoral process in the Palestinian territories.
I also believe that this is a good opportunity to express our hope that the circumstances will not prevent President Mahmud Abbas from accepting the European Parliament's standing invitation for him to come here whenever he likes.
<d>
. Mr President –, the strength of one s commitment ’ to gender equality should not be measured by support for the establishment of a Gender Institute.
The rapporteurs explain that they support that body: ‘ since it ensures that the overarching objective of gender equality... will not be second to any other anti-discrimination policy at EU level ’.
This misconceived objective explains why a separate institute is in fact a bad idea.
There is no hierarchy of oppression.
The promoters see it as more important to have the kudos of an exclusive body than the reality of an across-the-board transformation of society.
The Gender Institute should in fact be part of the new EU Agency on Fundamental Rights, just as the Anti-Racism Monitoring Centre will be.
If gender is the only equality objective that stays outside the Fundamental Rights Agency, that will create an unbalanced model as well as weakening the latter agency.
It may also ensure that gender equality becomes an isolated backwater rather than the highly visible flag-carrier that its supporters want.
It seems to me quite defensive to say that you need a separate institute to ensure that gender equality remains high on the EU political agenda.
On the contrary, women can spearhead the campaign for equality in human rights for all through the Fundamental Rights Agency.
That is the opinion of the UK s Equal Opportunities Commission ’ and I endorse that.
<d>
– Mr President, my political group will not be voting in favour of the Brok report, mainly for the following reasons:
The report, especially point 10 with its deliberate obscurity, formulates a dual strategy.
It leaves the back door wide open for accession prospects to turn into a formula for a special relationship, about which the German Christian Democrats are passionate.
The point on Kosovo, with its hazy wording, reflects the doublespeak within the Union and the trend towards gradual disengagement from the clear requirements of UN resolution 1244.
My political group emphasises the demand for Turkey to implement the preconditions set with a specific timetable, starting with the faithful application, without infringements, of the Ankara Protocol.
Finally, my political group supports, among other things, Amendment 19 on a mutually acceptable resolution of the problem with the name of the FYROM and the revised Amendment 4 on Cyprus.
<d>
In Poland there is growing dissatisfaction with the European Union ’ s agricultural policy.
The feelings of Polish farmers are well illustrated by their protest banners: ‘ the Union means bankruptcy for the Polish countryside ’.
The farmers demands ’ include renegotiation of the Accession Treaty, initiation of protection procedures in the soft fruit and vegetable markets and in the apple market, suspension of sugar market liberalisation and the release of the milk restructuring quota of 416 000 tonnes.
Poland has been allocated a quota of 9.3 million tonnes of milk, whereas it needs approximately 12.5 million tonnes.
This has already led to farmers being charged an overproduction penalty, and as from 2010 will result in Poland having to import milk and milk products.
In this way, Poland is gradually losing its food security.
Europe too is losing its food security.
We need to ask ourselves a fundamental question: what are we aiming at?
<d>
Mr President, the unification process within Europe is far from complete.
Regions of the new Member States will continue to trail behind the old Union ‘ ’ in terms of their levels of economic and social development for many years to come.
At the same time, as the European Union, we have to face the challenges of globalisation.
This is why we urgently need to adapt our policy areas to a changing reality.
I welcome the fact that the European Social Fund, as the Commissioner reminded us, places emphasis on education and on doing away with inequalities in employment.
It has also decided to invest in human resources, providing opportunities for disabled people.
New regulations on funds and funds – have always given citizens grounds for optimism – will show that the Union can function effectively, even without a new Constitution, within the framework of the existing Treaties.
<d>
Mr President, I am pleased that the Finnish Prime Minister mentioned more effective European institutions today.
This is a major issue at the moment, when the European Union is at a crossroads.
In my view we should not restrict the competences of the Council, but increase those of the European Parliament as the body elected by the citizens, and restrict the competences of the Commission, in whose election the citizens have had no say.
I am pleased with the Finnish Presidency s support ’ for the idea of greater transparency for European institutions, as transparency is a vital issue.
It is a good thing that the Presidency has been positive in assessing the latest EU enlargement;
I believe that in the coming six months there will be a good atmosphere for the next gradual and sensible expansion of EU structures.
When the President of the Council speaks of the need to work towards greater European competitiveness, I hope that this is not mere words, and that the Council will translate this promise into concrete action, for instance in the services sector, and that there will be an end to all the restrictions that the unfortunate Services Directive in its current form imposes in this field.
<d>
Mr President, I would like first of all to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Claudio Fava, and the team from the secretariat that has supported him in his wonderful work.
Despite what may be gleaned from the brief speech by the representative of the Council, we do not look to Washington.
We look to the European capitals.
We look to the Council, in Brussels, waiting for it to commit itself to the truth which has not yet come, to explain to us the why and the how of what we now know.
Because, just like archaeologists who gradually go on digging up small items through small excavations and then put all of that information together to produce a map of a city that had been hidden and the precise whereabouts of which nobody knew, the Commission, with the invaluable support of other people, of NGOs, in cooperation with the Council of Europe etc., has managed to draw up that map, to uncover and bring to light that hidden city, which is a plan designed for the systematic violation of the fundamental rights of the citizens on the theoretical premise of protecting our fundamental rights; we should protect our rights and our security by violating the rights of others.
That is the approach our work has been taking.
That is something that could not have happened without the active support or deliberate passivity of the Member States of the European Union.
That is our conclusion.
That is our moral conviction, and no one will be able to take it away from us, with or without votes.
We are dealing with a great jigsaw puzzle in which it is not sufficient for any State to say that no crime has taken place on their territory, if it turns out, for example, that the role played by that State in this overall plan was to give logistical support to the aircraft so that the people taking part in this great drama could rest beforehand or afterwards.
We are therefore still awaiting coherent explanations from the Council and the Member States so that we may know the truth and guarantee respect for the European Union's fundamental values, for which we are all supposed to be fighting.
<d>
The origin marking of a product represents the strength and the transparency of the product, a guarantee for the consumer and a necessary act of protection with regard to a nation s work ’ and its businesses.
The protection of European products (at least when this is entrusted to the clarity of markings, of production processes and of all those guarantees on products that a consumer has a right to know about and that, if you will, are also ethically necessary) is also crucial to the fair competition ‘ 'that precisely the dominant criteria of the free market' ‘ (which should therefore be free, but properly competitive) require.
Origin marking is not in itself a sufficient guarantee of the above, but it does at least represent a first step.
Making origin marking compulsory, as what we are discussing here provides for, is only a first, crucial step in protecting against those products that are flooding the European market, competing unfairly with our products and causing damage to our businesses and our work.
The traceability of a product – the complete transparency of the production process would be better – and an appropriate acknowledgement of the quality and the research and also of the craft and industrial traditions of the nations of Europe are also guarantees designed to protect consumers, as well as European businesses and industries.
That is why I voted in favour of the new regulation, even though I must stress that I regard it merely as a first step.
<d>
– Mr President, Commissioner, unfortunately the ecological disasters caused by accidents at sea continue to constitute a serious danger to the seas and coastal areas of Europe, while the ability of the Member States to deal with these accidents is often inadequate.
That is why it is important for us to give the EMSA, which provides the Member States with important support, the necessary financial security for it to do its job.
It is very important that its duties be extended, so that the EMSA can acquire every effective new means for combating all forms of deliberate and accidental pollution.
The provision of operational support to the Member States must be strengthened by providing specially equipped vessels to combat pollution and creating a central satellite photograph transmission centre for surveillance and prompt location.
Nonetheless, the Agency must also address other matters, such as the disposal of the oil recovered and air surveillance, activities for which additional funding will be required.
Finally, let us not forget that the Agency's action complements that of the Member States.
Consequently, action by the Member States also needs to be strengthened.
<d>
– Madam President, Commissioner, as we have already heard said today, Daphne is the most important programme aimed against violence, and so it is all the more important that it should be kept separate from the anti-drug programme.
Putting the two together in this way would certainly have resulted in even more misunderstandings and in incomprehension of what the European Union was up to, particularly among the persons affected by them, and I am glad that this is not going to happen.
This programme is a successful one, and must be continued, as visibly and comprehensibly as possible, as a response to increasing violence, and this separation is helpful to this end.
I am sure, too, that the doubling of its budget is not only encouraging but also necessary, constituting as it does a broadening of the range of goals and actions.
I would particularly like to highlight the campaign against people-trafficking, in particular against the trafficking of women and children, which calls for a high degree of vigilance and a great deal of work in view of the need for extended networks and for the financial resources required to that end.
I would like, then, to give my forthright support to Mrs Gröner s proposal ’ that cooperation projects to combat people-trafficking be extended to include third countries, since cooperation with countries of origin is vital.
Despite all this, Daphne is no more than a drop in the ocean.
It is particularly in the Member States that the campaign against violence must be continued with greater vigour, and must also be enshrined in law.
I would refer in this regard to the eviction law, which has been implemented for some considerable time in Austria, and also in many other countries, the effect of which is that those who commit acts of violence are required to leave the home.
I would also like to mention the anti-stalking law that is now in place in Austria, the object of which is to address the issue of psychological violence, something that is not yet taken seriously.
<d>
The European social model faces significant challenges, related primarily to the changes in the economic environment and social transformation.
Several elements of these changes have already been mentioned here today.
In my view, a key question is the need to create ever more jobs.
For this purpose, and in relation to the social model, it is important to stress: only more jobs, and therefore, obviously, support for the small and medium-sized enterprise sector can make it possible even to speak of elements of change within the social model.
I am delighted to hear what Commissioner Spidla has also said, that this is a question of preserving European values.
In order to succeed in doing so, it is clear that structural changes within the European social model are also necessary.
The main question is through what EU strategy and at what rate of change can this be achieved?
In this regard, I am of the opinion that we need to harmonise EU policies, and I especially welcome the aim set out in the report: a strengthened, open method of coordination so that national parliaments and the European Parliament can play a more active role in this.
I am convinced that greater cooperation and joint European consensual positions are necessary on the major political questions.
Therefore, common European statements, and policies tailored to each Member State, are the approach we must follow.
As regards future prospects, this declaration is sufficiently pragmatic and clearly shows that we must work together.
Problems can only be solved by joining our forces, not by fragmenting them.
I consider this to be a good, defensible report and I ask that the greatest possible number of Members, preferably from the widest possible political spectrum, lend it their support.
<d>
President-in-Office of the Council.
(FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is an honour for me to be here at Parliament's debate on the 2007 budget.
I can assure you that we will note with interest the issues raised during the discussion and pass them on to all our colleagues.
The budget's drafting process is a long one.
I appreciate the frank atmosphere of debate that has reigned all year long between Members of the Council and Parliament.
We last discussed the issue at the budget trilogue on 18 October.
I had an opportunity then to give a few tentative reactions to the draft amendments by the Committee on Budgets, to be voted on in plenary on Thursday.
Before I present certain important matters to the Council, I would like to deal with certain issues of quality, which are of importance for the work of the Union as a whole.
It is my intention now to speak frankly and call a spade a spade.
I believe that the Committee on Budgets, under the leadership of Mr Elles and Mr Grech, has worked without bias, by also focusing on what can be accomplished using our citizens' and taxpayers' money.
Hopefully, the Commission too will become involved in this work.
The value for money from Union taxes must be made a regular process.
The value for money concept must become something that pervades the entire budgetary procedure.
In my opinion, the first reading of the budget should concentrate on facts and figures.
I do not think that the budgetary authorities should make political statements at first reading.
I said at the Council presentation of the draft budget on 5 September 2006 that the EU's budgetary procedure is in need of innovation.
Without innovative budgetary solutions we cannot promote the Union's competitiveness or make the institutions' administration more efficient.
The budgetary authorities must take concrete action to achieve their objectives in this 2007 budget.
From the Council's viewpoint, Parliament's intention to increase payment appropriations significantly, when there is no proven need to do so, is not the right way to build a bridge between the EU and the general public.
An increase on this scale would only result in an enormous surplus in the first year.
The 2007 budget should be based on realistic and justified appropriation needs.
Halving the common foreign and security policy budget is simply not acceptable.
In the interinstitutional agreement concluded five months ago, Parliament approved an average sum of EUR 250 million per annum.
That being the case, I believe that the EUR 159 million advocated by the Commission and the Council is a reasonable figure.
I would therefore ask how Parliament's suggestion of EUR 73 million can be justified.
I would hope that the plenary session will act responsibly with regard to these two whole areas.
The budgetary authorities need to develop a procedure for the use of reserves in the very near future.
Appropriations should not be set aside merely for tactical reasons.
Here too, the provisions of the Financial Regulation must be complied with to the letter.
As we all know well, the 2007 budget is the first to be covered by the new interinstitutional agreement.
It is very important that all of its old familiar aspects, such as ceilings and adequate margins, are respected right from the start.
The new agreement also has new provisions on, for example, pilot projects and preparatory operations.
I would highlight the importance of these provisions, which clearly state that pilot projects and preparatory operations are not the exclusive right of one budgetary authority.
Both Parliament and the Council must also respect this aspect of the content of the new interinstitutional agreement.
The 2007 budget is a package.
It is important that the budgetary authorities establish the jointly agreed package within the framework of the budgetary procedure.
The crucial elements of the overall package are interlinked.
Finally, I would like to return to the revision of the Financial Regulation.
This is a subject that Parliament and the Commission have been anxious about, and they have been urging the Council to make haste.
President Borrel last raised the matter in his discussions with Prime Minister Vanhanen on 17 October.
It is with pleasure that I can now state that the Council adopted a common position on the revision of the Financial Regulation on 19 October.
We can therefore hold negotiations with Parliament on the Financial Regulation on 21 November.
I am sorry that we have not been able to keep to the timetable proposed by the Commissioner responsible for the budget in her letter in June.
The Commission had hoped that the meeting would be held last week.
I believe, however, that the timetable that I have referred to will give everyone sufficient time to formulate a comprehensive overall solution.
I hope that these brief comments of mine have done something to clarify the Council's opinions.
I earnestly believe that Parliament and the Council can reach a good common solution on the budget for 2007 in the discussions in the weeks ahead.
<d>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the recommendation in relation to the Common Position incorporates numerous amendments made by this House at first reading.
Although, as Mrs Gröner has just said, the budget for the period from 2007 to 2013 provides EUR 885 million for the 'Youth in Action' programme on the basis of the Interinstitutional Agreement on the Financial Perspective for the same period, I would nevertheless like to remind the House that the amount envisaged in the Commission's original proposal was EUR 913 million, and, this House having demanded an increase to EUR 1.1 billion, we have now, in the Common Position, ended up with EUR 885 million.
While that may well not reflect what we aspired to, it does give us the security to plan ahead for the coming years, and it is good that we can adopt it in this form today or tomorrow.
'Youth in Action' is primarily aimed at young people between the ages of 15 and 28, although some projects are open to 13-year olds and 30-year olds.
My group is glad that this House has been able to take the initiative in highlighting such important aspects of the Common Position as, for example, young people's participation in democratic life, the promotion of such fundamental values as human dignity, human rights, tolerance and non-discrimination, protection for participants by means of proper insurance - which is a very important consideration - the European Youth Weeks, seminars and structured dialogues involving young people, exchange schemes for young people in Europe and the neighbouring countries and, not least, EUR 2 million in financial support for the European Youth Forum.
While thanking Mrs Gröner, I would also like to say that we hope that the unamended Common Position of the Council will meet with widespread support from this House tomorrow.
<d>
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, with the Conventional Weapons Convention taking place this week and the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention next week, it is important that the EU's voice is heard.
One main area that concerns me - the Commissioner talked about it - is the use of cluster bombs.
We have seen the widespread use in recent conflicts: Iraq, Afghanistan and Lebanon, to name but a few.
Because they are not covered by the 1997 Treaty on Landmines they are used with impunity, but they still have the same devastating effect, with civilians being killed or maimed for years to come.
According to the report 'Fatal Footprint', published this month by Handicap International, the Israeli defence force delivered at least four million bomblets into Lebanon between July and August this year.
Worldwide, civilians constitute 98% of all recorded cluster bomb casualties.
That is one of the reasons I call on the Council and the Commission to endorse the growing movement for change within the international community and the moves by countries, amongst them Belgium and Norway, to establish national legislation to ban cluster munitions from their territories and armed forces.
I would also like to applaud the Red Cross for its campaign and call for a ban on the use of cluster bombs, for stockpiles to be destroyed and for clearance programmes to be stepped up.
As far as biological and toxic weapons are concerned, we must put more pressure on the United States Government, which has refused to countenance a legally binding verification protocol.
That is damaging the future of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention and its credibility.
We must also make sure that a permanent secretariat is set up to oversee the Convention's implementation.
<d>
Member of the Commission.
(EL) Madam President, the research that the Parliament Member referred to does confirm the Commission's opinion that a lot of things need to be done to improve consumer confidence in the internal market.
However, if we consider where we started, where we begun, and where we are today, we should not adopt such a completely negative view.
The progress has been significant and we can witness it through the measures we have taken and implemented over the past years.
However, the Commission does not rest and continues to act in the direction of boosting consumer confidence, but the Member States have also an important role to play.
Despite low confidence, which is due to several factors, one of the most important ones is the lack of a harmonised consumer protection system; this means that consumers do not know what to expect when they go shopping outside the country's borders.
However they must acknowledge that a lot of things have been achieved during the past years in the direction of solving these problems.
Moreover, it is clear that a lot more needs to be done to increase consumer confidence, especially with respect to the existing legislation and its implementation.
Both the measures that have been taken as well as those that are being planned are intended for dealing with the increasing number of unfair or illegal practices.
Has anything been done at European Union level?
First of all let me reassure you that the Commission has never ignored any complaint that it has received or continues to receive through its networks.
On the contrary, in the past such complaints have made things happen, for example the approval of the legislation against unfair trade practices.
Moreover, they play an important part in the data and information base for future actions, for example for time-sharing.
With the legislation on time-sharing we will cover travel products that are not covered by law and therefore do not provide an acceptable level of consumer protection.
The other legislation I mentioned, namely directive 2005 / 29 on unfair trade practices, prohibits aggressive practices such as sale under pressure, misleading market promotion methods and unfair advertising.
European Union consumers are protected equally whether shopping in their own country or in other Member States or over the Internet; moreover the horizontal nature of this protection will allow it to control new practices that will arise as the market develops.
Apart from that, directive 2000 / 31 on electronic commerce has imposed information requirements with the purpose of guaranteeing total consumer information regarding the trader's identity with respect to the commercial nature of communication over the Internet, actual price and technical means.
Regulation 2006 / 2004 on cooperation regarding consumer protection will allow national competent authorities to take swift action for dealing with ruthless and unfair cross-border traders, wherever they might be in the European Union.
In the proposal for a regulation regarding the law that will be applied in the agreements that is' Rome I Regulation ', the Commission's proposal will significantly increase consumer confidence bearing the benefit of a legislation with which they are already familiar.
Moreover, we have the European Consumer Centre networks or Economic Conflict Resolution Networks that will inform consumers on their rights and assist them in guaranteeing their rights through court appeals or out-of-court settlements in cross-border cases.
As Parliament is aware, in the future the Commission will proceed to review the legislation on consumer protection.
Quite soon a Green Paper will be approved for wider public consultation.
Its goal is to find a way to modernise and improve existing legislation with the purpose of increasing consumer and enterprise confidence so that they can buy and sell within the borders of the internal market.
Moreover, the issue of consumer protection will be examined within the context of the upcoming strategy on consumer policy.
As you can see, on the one hand our investigations do indicate that there are still serious problems but on the other, I believe you understand that the Commission does not rest or remain passive.
On the contrary, it is taking steps which are part of a complete programme for dealing with the drawbacks that have been noted by the investigation.
<d>
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their fruitful and constructive cooperation.
The vote on this report was postponed several times, but in my view the wait has been worth it, and the negotiations have shown that we have managed to work out a compromise with the Council at first reading.
It is important that the regulation should be adopted at first reading, because the Member States need instruments in order to achieve the air quality targets we have set.
It is deplorable that every year in Europe there are 370 000 premature deaths because of poor air quality.
This shocking figure must be minimised.
The compromise on which we are to vote tomorrow is substantially different from the Commission's proposal, because a second step was added by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
The so-called Euro 6 step brings limit values that are ambitious and realistic.
With this compromise we are at last effectively tackling the problem of fine particulates.
This is being achieved through the introduction of particle filters.
The limit value for the mass of particulate emissions is being reduced from the Euro 4 value of 25 mg / km to 5 mg / km.
Compared to the Euro 4 emissions standard in force today, this corresponds to a reduction of 80%.
Furthermore, the particle count will be measured at the very latest when the Euro 6 step enters into force on 1 September 2014.
By measuring the particle count, particles of the magnitude of PM2.5, which are especially harmful, will be reduced. This too will bring about progress in improving air quality and public health in Europe.
The greatest step forward in combating motor vehicle emissions, however, is in the area of nitrogen oxides.
Here, the first step involves reducing the limit to 180 mg / km for diesel passenger cars and to 60 mg / km for petrol passenger cars.
Compared to today's Euro 4 emissions standard, this corresponds to a reduction of 28% for diesel passenger cars and a reduction of 25% for petrol passenger cars.
The greatest step forward, however, will be taken in the planned Euro 6 step and affects diesel passenger cars.
In this stage, the emission of nitrogen oxides will be lowered by 56%, from 180 mg / km to 80 mg / km.
As far as the time frame is concerned, I would like to point out that the Euro 5 step comes into force on 1 September 2009 for new types of vehicle and that the Euro 6 step applies from 1 September 2014.
In fact, however, Euro 5 and Euro 6 motor vehicles will be introduced more quickly, because thanks to this Regulation the Member States have the opportunity to promote vehicles with Euro 5 and Euro 6 emissions standards before the 1 September 2009 through tax incentives.
A look into the history books tells us that in 2001 for example, motor vehicles with the Euro 4 emissions standard were already available on the market, even though the Euro 4 emissions standard only entered into force on 1 January 2005.
Not only does Euro 5 ensure better air quality in Europe, but this Regulation and the compromise we have arrived at also improve the rights of manufacturers in Europe.
Thus consumers must now demonstrate the durability of pollution control devices over 160 000 km instead of 80 000 km.
Furthermore, in Chapter 3 of the Regulation the rights of consumers are protected, in so far as it is laid down that consumers may continue to seek out repair shops themselves.
This was achieved by securing access to vehicle repair information and by laying down a new format in this Regulation, the so-called OASIS format, for the provision of repair information.
Moreover I do not want to neglect to point out that this Euro 5 Regulation is a good example of the reduction of bureaucracy in Europe.
The Euro 5 Regulation cancels out 25 directives, and I very much welcome this as an example of 'better lawmaking'.
In conclusion I would like to ask you to support this compromise we have arrived at, so that consumer rights are reinforced and so that air quality is improved.
The compromise was negotiated as an entire package, and any deviation from the complete package would inevitably lead to a second reading, the consequence of which would be that we would have to wait for this instrument, Euro 5, for improving air quality in Europe, and, therefore, that an improvement in air quality would be shelved.
<d>
Member of the Commission.
Mr President, I should like to thank Parliament for this discussion and the Members for their remarks.
I think we can all agree that despite recent positive developments, the situation concerning women's rights in Turkey needs to be improved.
While progress has been made towards improving legislation, implementation remains a challenge and needs to be speeded up.
We are now looking forward to further positive developments and hope that the work of the European Parliament and the Commission will support this process.
Last but not least, I would like to underline the importance of the participation of civil society in this effort.
I shall briefly mention some figures which might be of interest to you. This is in relation to the funds allocated by the Commission.
Combating domestic violence against women: EUR 2.968 million.
Establishing shelters for women subjected to domestic violence: EUR 8.5 million.
Let me once again express my gratitude to the rapporteur for the excellent work which has been done.
<d>
author. - (PT) Mr President, the text that we are submitting today for Parliament's approval very much reflects the fact that this situation can only be described as a human tragedy of massive proportions.
I should like to thank the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Mr António Guterres, for drawing attention to this disaster, which took place on 7 February.
I should also like to give a special word of commendation to the Swedish authorities for their exceptional European-level response to the human disaster.
I should particularly like to commend the Egyptian authorities, which is the non-bordering country that has done by far the most to welcome these refugees, and I should like to make a heartfelt plea to the Egyptian authorities not to prevent these refugees from arriving or to suspend the conditions for hosting them when they arrive.
Most of all, however, I wish to call on the Commission and the Council - as Mr Posselt, who is here today, so aptly reminded us - to open their eyes, to go to Iraq and to see what is happening there.
A disaster of this nature would never be possible unless it were organised from somewhere, as was the case previously in Rwanda and in the Balkans.
We can no longer turn a blind eye; we must go to Iraq and understand what is happening.
In this connection, I should like to say that I am proud that I was there recently.
I have drawn up a report and invite all my fellow Members to have a look at it on the Internet.
<d>
Mr President, honourable Members, I should like to thank the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and in particular Mr Klinz for his excellent report on prudential assessments in the financial sector and for the amount of effort that has gone into achieving a common position between the three institutions.
We share Mr Klinz's view that this proposed directive will make the whole approach to acquisitions in the financial sector more effective.
We must clearly ensure that commercial decisions on acquisitions in the financial sector are clearly and transparently vetted by the relevant body.
Legitimate commercial decision-making must not be frustrated by overzealous bodies or by political interference.
Where both the acquirer and his target are under inspection, the bodies responsible must work together, exchange information and help each other out.
This will serve to speed up the assessments process.
It is frequently said that we should not indiscriminately open our doors to the invasion of capital from third countries or to the takeover of our institutions by big business.
I firmly believe that even though we have to protect the interests of our markets, our institutions and our consumers, we must continue to honour our commitments in international forums such as the WTO.
We must also ensure that our trading partners also honour their commitments.
The current state of affairs is most encouraging.
Several institutions based in the EU have successfully penetrated third countries where they have concluded mergers and takeovers in the financial sector.
At the same time, however, we should not overlook problems in the EU, where organisations from some Member States have faced problems relating to the acquisition of firms in other Member States.
The purpose of this directive is neither to encourage nor to discourage acquisitions in the financial sector.
Our objective must not be to disturb the normal functioning of the market.
We must ensure, however, that there is a solid framework in place leading to the assessment, and then the approval or rejection, of potential acquisitions.
The key point here is that prudential assessments must not become the mere exercise of discretionary powers, as this would result in delays and obstructions and would be ineffective and uneconomic.
Also covered in the report are issues of hostile as opposed to friendly takeovers.
Hostile takeovers are part and parcel of the normal functioning of the market.
The Commission believes that the authorities should adopt a position in favour of such initiatives or against them.
Irrespective of whether an initiative is friendly or hostile, the decision rests with the shareholders.
There need to be willing sellers in any acquisition.
If, according to the directive, the prudential criteria have been met, there is no reason to query the value of agreements between willing purchasers and sellers.
To summarise: clear, fair and predictable approaches and processes are of vital importance to the proper functioning of the internal market.
I believe that with this directive we will remove the current ambiguity.
Thank you for your attention.
<d>
(HU) Hopefully tomorrow we will reach the end of a long journey.
Two years ago, when we began debating this directive, we experienced flooding throughout Europe, water sweeping away houses and destroying dams everywhere.
My country, Hungary, is a downstream country, a basin into which a great deal of water flows from many sources.
Two of Europe's five largest rivers flow through my homeland, and so it is not surprising that it has the largest amount of water per capita.
Naturally the damages, too, are enormous.
In 2005, at the time of the great flood that has already been mentioned, we were obliged to invest more than EUR 200 million in flood protection.
There was a lot at stake for us.
If I had to stress a particularly important element of the new directive, I would definitely speak of cooperation.
I feel that joint, planned preparation, sharing of information, and the provision of mutual assistance are all elements that appear in this regulation, and make it clear that we can only deal with and resolve the problem of flooding if we work together.
I agree with Mr Dimas: the future, global climate change, and the responses to these challenges constitute one of the most important questions.
It is probable that there will be more frequent and more unpredictable floods across Europe, along with more significant rises in water levels and greater destruction.
I feel that this directive will soon be put to the test, and I am absolutely sure it will come through with flying colours.
Fewer human lives will be lost and less damage caused thanks to this directive.
I am completely satisfied with the compromises reached, and congratulate Mr Seeber for his excellent work.
I feel that we have really succeeded in drafting a directive that will protect human lives and increase physical safety in Europe.
<d>
The resolution on transatlantic relations - undersigned by the Right and the Social Democrats and adopted today by the majority in Parliament - is a useful snapshot of the current state of EU-USA relations.
The majority in Parliament has set the agenda and its priorities, of which I should like to highlight the following:
'welcomes the improved climate of EU-US relations on an equal basis' and expresses the desire to share responsibilities in what is termed 'global governance';
'strengthening the transatlantic market', with the liberalisation of financial services a 'key issue', and calling for 'regulatory convergence and a level playing field, in view of the Multilateral Agreement on Investment';
the affirmation of 'serious opportunities for the EU and US to work closely together' in relation to 'the Western Balkans, the South Caucasus region, Central Asia, the Middle East, Afghanistan, the Mediterranean, Latin America and Africa';
strengthening cooperation in the context of what it calls' fighting terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction 'as' the greatest security challenges for both partners', with NATO a 'transatlantic forum for political debate in a true partnership of equals'.
This agenda expresses the ambitions of the major European capitalist powers, in particular Germany, in relation to the USA.
<d>
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group. - (SV) Madam President, the fact that homophobia is still a problem in Europe in 2007 is deeply unfortunate and alarming.
What is still more unfortunate is that there are fellow Members here in this House who, through their clearly homophobic statements, help make the situation worse for homosexuals, bisexuals and transsexuals.
They make such statements not only here in the European Parliament but also, to a large extent, on their home territories.
One of the consequences of stirring up homophobic feeling is that homosexuals, bisexuals and transsexuals are in danger of being exposed to both physical and psychological violence, as happened at quite a few Gay Pride parades around Europe last year.
What is even worse is when faith and religion are used as excuses for discriminating against EU citizens.
You can surely work out what I have in mind.
These are medieval values that do not belong in our modern society.
Europe in 2007 should be further along the road than that.
Let us combat homophobia wherever it occurs: in politics, in the media and in the circles in which we all move.
<d>
(LT) Russia is behaving disgracefully in Estonia and is not even trying to hide its behaviour.
The Russians have commenced an economic blockade against a European Union Member State.
In the past, Russia has behaved more subtly in Latvia or Lithuania, or in other countries, which is perhaps why the European Union has been nonchalant about most of Russia's actions.
After the events in Estonia I urge you to reconsider the European Union's relations with Russia.
Strategic partnership should be replaced by principled, honourable and pragmatic cooperation.
In my opinion, it is essential to postpone the 18 May meeting in Samara.
We need to lay out the European Union's opinion to Russia on what conditions are essential for such meetings to be able to take place again in the future.
Javier Solana must go to Moscow and clearly state the European Union's position.
Europe has enough arguments.
My fear is that some European Union leaders will want to have yet another photo opportunity with the antidemocratic Putin, rather than defend the European Union's democratic values.
<d>
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, we regard the Single European Sky as the most important project for the future of air transport.
The Commission always emphasised its importance under your predecessor and I also believe it to be the case.
We adopted the 2004 package of regulations.
We still have a kind of patchwork in the sky, with 58 national airspace blocks, even though we know we would really only need one, or to be generous perhaps three to six.
We know that this patchwork - the figures were given earlier - has adverse effects on safety, and of course also on the economy and consumers.
We know about the stacking and congestion in the skies and nowadays we are putting far more emphasis on emissions.
We have realised that we can take a big step forward here.
In its progress report, the Commission showed how slowly the Member States are moving, even if there are some initiatives, and proposed a few ways of exerting pressure.
Now I am not saying that is meaningless, nor 'I told you so', but as early as 2003 we said the bottom-up approach would not work, because even at that time we suspected that Member States would get embroiled in discussions about areas of sovereignty in regard to service provision and that such crucial matters need to be regulated by top-down legislative rules.
At the time we thought perhaps Eurocontrol could propose rules and make a proposal based simply on the substance, on functionality, which the Member States could then quarrel about, rather than waiting until they themselves had created another kind of patchwork, in a bottom-up approach.
What is important now is seriously to consider whether we need to review the legal framework.
That would be the only way to exert real pressure and bring about the necessary changes.
<d>
in writing. - By insisting that non-EU spouses of EU nationals must have lived in another EU Member State before being entitled to residency in Ireland, the Government is I believe in breach of the 2004 directive.
Furthermore, singling out the spouses of non-Irish EU nationals for the issuing of deportation orders is contrary to EU legislation which bans discrimination based on nationality.
I would remind the Commission that they informed the European Parliament in 2006 that the 2004 directive on residency should be interpreted by Member States in accordance with the European Court of Justice decisions in July 2002 (Case No C / 459 / 99 (MRAX)) and again in April 2005 (Case No C / 157 / 03).
These decisions established that the right of entry and residency in the Community of a third-country national who is a member of an EU citizen's family arises from that relationship, and depends neither on the legality of their previous residence in the Community nor on the presentation of a residence permit or other permit issued by another Member State.
Ireland's actions clearly breach those court decisions.
Consequently the Commission is obliged under the Treaties to take action against the Irish Government.
<d>
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group. - (ES) Mr President, the Commission has defined three essential axes to exploit the potential of digital technology: online accessibility, digitisation of analogical collections and preservation and storage of digital contents, and we are well aware of this.
With respect to digitisation, it is common knowledge that the Commission, through a recommendation in August last year, asked the Member States to coordinate their efforts to ensure synergy on a European scale.
The Council unanimously supported the recommendation, but I wish to take this opportunity - although it is a pity the Council is not in attendance -firstly to inquire of the Commission as to the real progress made by the Member States in this area, and secondly to ascertain whether sufficient consideration has been taken of non-state authorities, which, as we know, are responsible for culture in most decentralised countries.
With regard to another aspect, online accessibility, as I said, we all agree that there must be a multilingual interface and content must be guaranteed.
It is a true joy to enter the digital library webpage and see that, apart from the 23 official Community languages, the contents also appear in Icelandic and Serbian.
Today we are celebrating the European Day of Languages and you, Mrs Reding, made a major contribution to its creation.
You have also said on countless occasions, Commissioner, and rightly so, that big and small languages do not exist, that all of them form part of Europe's cultural wealth, and thus I would like to be given the chance to see an occasional reference in the digital library, or content rather than a reference, concerning languages such as my own, which are not official in the European Union.
<d>
Mr President, we have already had mention today of Libya, and I want to give it another billing.
Libya, quite properly, was made to pay for the Lockerbie terrorist atrocity, but Libya as a global sponsor of terrorism has yet to make full reparation.
The IRA's vile campaign of terror reached its most deadly when equipped with Libyan Semtex and weaponry, permitting Martin McGuinness and its other army council leaders to unleash the most vicious phase of their campaign.
Without Libya, hundreds of innocents would not have died.
Thus, tonight in this House, I want to back the present campaign by the victims' group in Northern Ireland - by the name of FAIR - to bring Libya to international account by forcing it to pay compensation, as occurred with Lockerbie.
Just as the EU pressurised Libya over the Bulgarian nurses, so it should support justice for IRA victims by pressing Libya to settle the litigation now issued against it by FAIR in the United States of America.
<d>
(DE) Mr President, very briefly, I would like to list what I regard as the most important points arising from this work programme.
Undoubtedly a key theme for 2008 is the Health Check for the common agricultural policy.
The 2003 CAP reform should be reviewed and simplified, we all agree on that, and to that extent I hope, as rapporteur, that the important contributions that we in Parliament make to this own-initiative report will be taken into account in the ensuing legislative proposal.
This Health Check must help us find the right path towards a common agricultural policy for the post-2013 period.
A further project is the planned Green Paper on Agricultural Product Quality.
Quality must become an even greater focus in agriculture, and this applies to farm imports from third countries as well, which must conform to the same standards as those applicable to EU producers.
I am particularly keen on an initiative to promote the consumption of fruit in schools.
This is something which we in the PPE-DE Group have been championing for some time, and we are gratified that the Commission intends to take up this initiative.
Other key issues for 2008 such as the Milk Package, the 2008-2009 Budget Review, the Action Plan on EU Animal Health Strategy and the Review of Support for Less Favoured Areas will certainly make sure that there is no scope for any boredom in Parliament!
<d>
author. - (FI) Mr President, I wish to express my thanks for the excellent levels of cooperation with the shadow rapporteurs of the political groups in the negotiations on this resolution.
Climate change is happening now, and it is advancing more quickly than predicted.
A dramatic indication of this was that at the end of last summer a million square meters of the ice in the Arctic Ocean melted, an area the equivalent of Finland, Sweden and Norway combined.
The message the scientists are sending out about the advance of climate change and the urgent need to cut emissions is becoming an ever more alarming one.
It is also echoed in the advance information on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change meeting in Valencia this week.
It is important that there is no gap left between the Kyoto Protocol and the next climate agreement.
That is why the post-2012 treaty must be ready no later than 2009.
At Bali the EU must do all it can to achieve a negotiating mandate to allow global warming to remain under two degrees.
The leading role assumed by the EU is crucial to this.
We are showing the way with our own measures to reduce our own emissions, but also by coordinating international negotiations.
It is vital to get all the industrialised countries involved, including the United States of America, although that will not be enough to save the climate.
It is just as crucial to get big developing countries, such as China and India, to accept limits on the increase in their emissions.
This is perhaps the hardest challenge in the history of international diplomacy.
We have to understand that if China, India and other similar countries accept limits to their emissions, it will mean a huge change in their way of thinking and the way they do things.
We have to be prepared to give them something back in return.
In other words, we also have to provide financial assistance for the breakthrough in clean, climate-friendly technology in these countries.
I would like to remind everyone that Nicholas Stern estimated that 1% of global gross domestic product each year would be needed to protect the climate.
After the Second World War the United States delivered 2% of their GDP in the form of Marshall Plan aid.
It was important to get reconstruction under way after the war, but it is still more important to prevent a comparable catastrophe as a result of climate change.
We must therefore also be prepared to pay for climate protection.
<d>
With this explanation of vote, we the undersigned Swedish Social Democrat Members of the European Parliament would like to clarify how we voted on the Braghetto report.
We think it is very important to set up a recovery plan for bluefin tuna. Bluefin tuna has been an endangered species for a long time following massive overfishing.
In time this risks damaging the whole ecosystem in the fishing waters concerned.
However, we think that the Commission's resolution is not entirely adequate and therefore voted against it.
We voted for the Committee's Amendments 4 and 6 - two amendments which entail the removal of two, in our opinion questionable, exemptions for bluefin tuna fishing.
We also supported Amendment 13 which would have meant that we should adopt a recovery plan worthy of the name.
The proposal went considerably further than the original proposal, which is something we fully support.
The level of bluefin tuna stocks is still dangerously low and the European Union must take greater responsibility for the recovery of bluefin tuna stocks.

With regard to the possibilities that new technologies offer the tourist industry, tourists are increasingly avoiding intermediaries and travel agents, and making tourist reservations, mainly for travel and accommodation, by electronic means.
Cases often arise where consumers are disappointed when they do not obtain the services for which they have paid in advance.
I was recently informed about practices at the Victoria Garden Suites Hotel in Strasbourg, when Slovak tourists were downgraded from a three-star to a two-star hotel and treated as if they were second-class citizens.
The hotel did not refund them the difference between the services they had paid for and those actually provided, although it was little enough to demand for this.
This development of the use of information technology for tourist services requires a consumer and personal data protection framework for electronic bookings.
It is important that consumers receive information that is correct, not deceptive, and that is up-to-date and unambiguous.
In the interests of consumer protection, certification of the sites that provide information and offer tourist services (reservation and payment) of an electronic nature would be helpful.
Nothing is worse for tourism than the dissatisfaction of European consumers, hence I have fully supported the report on 'A renewed EU tourism policy: towards a stronger partnership for European tourism', just as the rapporteur, Mr Costa, suggested, and I particularly identify with his focus on consumer protection.

in writing. - (PL) We are living in the 21st century, and have no option but to adjust to new and fast-changing circumstances.
That is why I warmly welcome the report by Mr Heaton Harris on the introduction of a paperless environment for customs and trade.
The provisions of this document are very relevant to modern Europe and should be introduced as a matter of urgency.
They refer to the tools with which to create a new generation of working environment in customs and trade.
I refer to the establishment of a paperless environment, which is so necessary mainly to relieve our officials, who are reeling from the demands of unnecessary administrative paper documentation.
We should also keep in mind issues pertaining to environmental protection and the quantities of trees that have to be sacrificed to meet the demand for paper required for this purpose.
I consider the introduction of electronic customs systems to be particularly important and urgent.
I also advocate the creation of 'Single Window' and 'One-Stop Shop' facilities.
I am convinced Europe should invest more in this type of solution, to ensure that the statements in the Lisbon Strategy become more than empty words.

(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, from Padania the situation in Campania seems like science fiction, from a Padania where separate collections are made, where taxes on waste are paid.
The fact that the left in government in our country, with a green environment minister, moreover, has to put the former chief of police in charge of waste, seems like something from another world.
We tell you plainly that Campania is no longer in the European legal space, dominated as it is by a shameful connection between politics and the Camorra which we have long denounced.
Commissioner, no more funding, suspend all funding, do not send a further cent to the Camorra, to the criminals.
Take the hard-working and honest North as an example!
Free the honest people of Campania from the thrall of the Camorra, in which various parties are caught up!
We want nothing to do with this, we are against this domination of politics by the mafia.
Federalism is what our country needs, if these people are to be helped!
There has to be change, the situation has to change!
Free those honest working people of the South from the yoke of the mafia!
That is what honest Padania has to say!

(ES) Mr President, I wish the Slovenian Presidency well.
It is an excellent symbol of the transformation of the European Union.
Some very important matters will be dealt with over the next six months, and I will mention a few.
Firstly, there is the Spring European Council, which will focus on the Lisbon Strategy.
The truth is that we are in a difficult economic situation: growth forecasts are declining as a result of the financial crisis, rising inflation, the strength of the euro and a very weak dollar, and the extremely high price of oil.
Food prices are also rising.
The public expect effective decisions that will help restore confidence in a time of uncertainty.
Externally there is the issue of Kosovo, which affects such important principles as the stability of borders throughout Europe.
Do not be hasty.
I think that the December European Council acted rather hastily.
It took decisions such as sending a civilian mission, but apparently with no agreement on the legal basis.
It is paradoxical that this is happening in the EU, a community based on the rule of law.
The issue of Kosovo is a delicate one, requiring caution.
Try hard to achieve a fresh Security Council resolution.
In May, as you mentioned, there will be the important Lima Summit with the Latin American countries, which are so close to Europe in terms of principles and values.
Lima should also be used as a lever to break the deadlock in the negotiations with Mercosur and to drive forward the negotiations with the Andean countries and Central America on their respective association agreements.
In March the expansion of the Schengen area will be a reality at airports.
This is a decisive time for the EU's external borders, which brings me to the fight against illegal immigration.
A meeting is planned between the ministers responsible for border control, which I think is very timely.
There is a need for increased cooperation between those ministers, and the officials looking after external borders need to be fully aware that they are doing not only a national job, but also a European one, and that they share responsibility for what happens throughout the Schengen area.
Finally, I would also ask you to work on the fight against terrorism.
The public expect the European Union to produce results in this area that is so significant and important for their lives.
<d>
Madam President, before you start counting the time, I would like to ask you to take the following into consideration: please give me the two minutes that I am entitled to so that I can respond out of courtesy to all of my colleagues, the Council and the Commission, but also, Madam President, I earnestly ask you to give me some separate time to answer the very serious, unjustified allusions that have been made about me.
May I count on your understanding, Madam President?
Thank you very much.
I am very grateful to almost all my colleagues - and I emphasise the word 'almost' - for their contributions, and I very especially take them on board.
I would like to say that the concerns that have been expressed here are not only the concerns of the rapporteur, but that they are also the concerns of the House.
It has been very gratifying for me to hear how well disposed the Council is and the wise words of compromise and also clarification from Vice-President Frattini.
I would therefore like to thank all my fellow Members, those who have honoured me with their support as well as those who have honoured me with their criticisms.
You should not forget that I have been a Member of Parliament for seventeen years, and still am, and I was the Director-General of Police for the Kingdom of Spain for two years.
I was.
That is how I am able to see both sides of the coin.
President-in-Office of the Council, I would therefore like once again to highlight the issues that concern us: we cannot fight crime on our own.
Crime is transnational.
Crime goes beyond borders, and our police forces, which are national, need to have in Europol an instrument to support and strengthen them.
Not one that interferes or overlaps with their work, but one that supports and strengthens them.
Guarantees are very important to us.
It is very important to us to support and strengthen Europol, but with three criteria: confidence, control and guarantees.
This is naturally what has been made clear in our report and in the contributions of fellow members.
Data protection in the Framework Decision in the third pillar as soon as possible is important to us.
It is extremely important to us that Parliament has control and it is very important to us to decisively and determinedly fight organised crime together.
Now, Madam President, due to the allusions, I would like to answer the second, much more unpleasant, question.
Mr Moreno does not respect judicial decisions.
The Supreme Court of the Kingdom of Spain and the Public Prosecutor at the Supreme Court of the Kingdom of Spain said these exact words in reference to my case.
I do not know if they translate well, but they said these exact words, 'no crime whatsoever'.
However, some people, such as Mr Moreno, have not had and do not have the intellectual and moral integrity to apologise for spreading something that they should not have spread.
What Mr Moreno has done here is to intoxicate Parliament comme d'habitude with issues that do not have anything to do with the report or with the heart of the matter.
He talks about morality and lack of dignity.
It is immoral and undignified not to respect judicial decisions and, on top of that, to throw them back in the face of a colleague who does have dignity and morality.
I will not say that Mr Moreno is undignified and immoral, but what I will say is that he has behaved in an undignified and immoral way.
What I will say in his defence is that I would like to think that they are not his own ideas, but that he has behaved, not like a messenger boy, but rather that this time he has had the brazenness to act as the messenger boy.
Why?
In order to unjustifiably discredit and perhaps in the vain attempt to get a few column inches in the Spanish press.
<d>
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group. - Madam President, every Olympics draws our attention to the preservation of human dignity as stated in the Olympic Charter.
The 2008 Beijing Olympics will specifically draw our attention to that preservation - or otherwise - in China.
Hopefully, this will bring pressure on the Chinese Government to rethink actions like the arrest of Hu Jia.
It is an opportunity for the country to improve its poor record in this area.
Instead, the Chinese Government seems determined to sweep human rights abuses under the rug, by arresting activists and protestors.
Of concern is the purchase of Western high-tech security equipment by the Chinese authorities, obviously intended to step up security during the games.
My concern is twofold. I fear that such security equipment will be used against the Chinese people this summer, and that it will remain in misuse after the summer.
We must either use the Olympics to promote human rights in China, or boycott them, and one thing we cannot do is have a big celebration of China if human rights continue to be so flagrantly disregarded.
<d>
Mr President, an absolute majority is not the same as the rule of law.
I accept that there is a minority in this House in favour of a referendum, and that there is a minority in this House against the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty.
But this House must nonetheless follow its own rule books.
And by popular acclamation to discard the rules under which we operate is indeed an act of arbitrary and despotic rule.
It is only my regard for you, Mr President, and my personal affection for you that prevents me from likening it to the Ermächtigungsgesetz of 1933, which was also voted through by a parliamentary majority.
I ask this House not to vote on this matter until we have...
(Protests)
<d>
Mr President, the debate today shows how sensitive this matter is to the European Parliament.
The topic of the day is the raison d'être for us.
It is about the wellbeing of Europeans in the future.
We have our different opinions about the tool bag - how we reach the Lisbon goals - but I think everyone in this House wants to reach the goals.
Even though I agree with Ms Jäätteenmäki that, unfortunately, we have not seen a lot of progress.
I think we have to speak about two different levels of action.
First, at European level, we have only one key thing we should do in order to increase competitiveness and that is the single market.
The European internal market is the biggest driver of competitiveness in a global context.
We also have a lot of red tape and we need to work with our SMEs - these are very much the key to European success.
Of course, then we need to concentrate on things at national level, at Member State level, and there we need much more action than we have seen lately, especially regarding the structural reforms to the labour market.
We heard today the Prime Minister of Sweden, who spoke about the importance of structural reforms to the labour market, also in terms of coping with demographic changes.
I think it is self-evident that Member States have not done their duty in this respect.
Also, I think that, on fiscal policy and macroeconomics, we have to end the era of budget deficits.
We really need to work on our macroeconomics.
This cannot be done by the Union, even though we have a single currency.
It must be done by the Member State politicians.
Finally, I would like to agree with Ms Starkevičiūtė, whose report is, I think, wonderful.
Financial services are one of the cornerstones of the internal market.
Financial services need much more attention, including at European level.
<d>
Member of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, I should like to begin with a brief personal comment.
I heard the contribution from Mr Dillen, representing a Belgian party of the far right, who indulged in a quite disgraceful comparison between circumstances in Belgium and those in Russia.
Obviously I am bound to refute his assertions.
I recognise in them the familiar methods to which his party habitually resorts and which merely amount to a form of insult.
Let me state very clearly that such methods reflect no credit on those who employ them.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is closely following developments in the wake of the demonstrations in Moscow and St Petersburg on 3 March: we are doing so not only via our delegation in Moscow but also through direct contacts with Member States.
In addition, we liaise regularly with Russian and international NGOs working in the field of human rights.
The Commission shares your concern about the apparent deterioration of the human rights situation in Russia and the incidence of reported human rights violations, particularly with regard to freedom of assembly and freedom of expression.
We were extremely disappointed when the OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights was forced to conclude that it was not feasible to send an election observation mission.
In its bilateral contacts with Russia, including at the highest level, the European Union regularly underscores the importance of respecting human rights.
In a month's time, we shall have one of our two annual consultations with Russia on the subject of human rights.
These consultations give us an opportunity to explore general trends in human rights in greater depth and to hear the Russian point of view on individual cases.
In the forthcoming consultation we will convey our concerns, particularly about the rights to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly, the problems posed by the rise of racism and xenophobia, and cooperation with Russia in international organisations such as the OSCE and the Council of Europe.
The consultations also enable us to raise the cases of individuals.
Before and after this consultation, we will meet a group representing Russian and international NGOs which work for human rights.
Such meetings put the European Union in touch with the concerns of human rights activists and enable us to exchange views directly.
Looking somewhat further ahead, we should soon be in a position to embark on negotiations on a new agreement between the European Union and the Russian Federation.
It will be a comprehensive agreement, embracing the growing number of policy areas in which we cooperate.
As the European Union statement following the Russian presidential election pointed out, we have a common interest in furthering our ties and we hope that our partnership will be consolidated and developed constructively under the presidency of Dmitri Medvedev.
We will take care, when negotiating the new agreement, to ensure that it reflects the values to which both sides have committed themselves: a thriving civil society and independent media are the natural and necessary allies of growth and stability in Russia.
We have learned this from our own experience in the European Union and it is a message that we shall doggedly continue - as neighbours and partners - to convey to our Russian friends both on a day-to-day basis and in discussions about the shape of our future relations.
I know already that the European Parliament will lend us its unstinting support in these efforts.
<d>
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, the report I am presenting follows on from the request made by Mrs Trüpel - who is here today and whom I welcome - and I, at the time of the 2007 Culture report three years ago, for greater recognition of the cultural industries, which I recall are now larger than the automotive industry in the European Union, accounting for 3.1% of the active population of the European Union and generating 2.6% of GDP.
I have therefore prepared this report by consulting as much as possible with all those involved in the sector.
Consequently I would like to thank all the experts and professionals from the industry, as well as web user and consumer associations and finally my colleagues in the Committee on Culture for all the discussions we have been able to hold on these crucial issues.
This report is based on the following postulate: culture and the economy have today become inseparable.
The economy needs culture and culture needs the economy.
In view of this, culture urgently needs to be restored to its rightful place on the Lisbon agenda.
With this in mind, I make a number of proposals in this report.
The first would be to set up a task force to explore the relationship between culture, creativity and innovation in the context of Community policies.
Secondly, it is essential make more room in our Community funding for the cultural industries.
In this report, at the level of the Member States I recommend private / public funding as well as the promotion of a regulatory and fiscal framework that favours cultural industries, and more specifically the application of tax credits and reduced rates of VAT to all cultural products, including online works.
I also call upon the Commission to look into the possibility of setting up a programme similar to the MEDIA programme for all the cultural industries.
Thirdly, this report proposes that culture be better incorporated into the European Union's external policies because - and I want to stress this - what makes Europe so rich is its culture or rather, as I should have said, the diversity of its culture.
I therefore invite the Commission and the Member States to increase the amount of aid for translation.
Finally, if you will allow me Mr President, I would like to return to the issue of intellectual property rights, which are the subject of a great number of amendments in this report.
On this subject, I strongly oppose the position of some Member States whose repressive measures are dictated by industries incapable of changing their economic model in line with the needs imposed by the information society.
Cutting off internet access is a disproportionate measure in view of the objectives.
This is a penalty with powerful effects, which could have serious repercussions in a society where internet access is essential for social inclusion.
Ladies and gentlemen, I think we need to make a distinction between mass piracy and consumers acting without a profit motive.
Rather than criminalising consumers, we need to set up new economic models that strike a balance between the ability to access cultural activities and content, cultural diversity and genuine remuneration for those who hold intellectual property rights.
It seems to me that this is the only way cultural Europe can truly enter the 21st century.
<d>
(EL) Mr President, there has recently been a growing clamour within the EU for the expansion of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, above all to meet Europe's energy demands.
The problem is the unchecked rise in the price of oil, the increasing demand from a number of countries with rapidly growing economies, regional disturbances in oil-producing countries, as well as the fact that renewable sources of energy or natural gas will cover a mere fraction of Europe's energy needs.
As a result, the construction of nuclear plants is being tabled for discussion.
Many questions worry European citizens.
Can the safe operation of nuclear power plants be guaranteed?
Do appropriate early warning systems exist to guarantee sufficient notice in the event of an operational problem?
Finally, how safe is the management of nuclear waste?
For all these reasons, I believe that on the initiative of the European Parliament and with the collaboration of the Commission, a dialogue could usefully be conducted leading to clear, unambiguous conclusions for European citizens.
I call on the French Presidency to make this issue a real priority in its agenda.
<d>
(RO) Mister President, European socialists hope that Europe becomes an example for the whole world in terms of life quality.
The 27 Member States are now building a new social Europe which will bring prosperity to all citizens of the European Union.
From the Union's budget for 2008, almost 45% is allocated to growth, innovation, job creation and economic and social cohesion, and 42,6% is allocated to agriculture.
Rural areas represent 90% of the European Union territory.
Despite the EURO 41 million allocated to agriculture in 2008, the increase of costs for agricultural works and the increase in energy prices brought about an increase in prices of agricultural products and caused the economic situation to deteriorate.
I consider that the grants policy for agriculture and adequate conditions for the promotion of investments in the field are the answer to part of the challenges the Union will encounter in the following years.
A developed agriculture will allow all European citizens to have access to healthy food and sufficient quantities, at affordable prices.
Healthy nutrition is a fundamental aspect of life quality.
<d>
Mr President, like many of my colleagues in the House today, I welcome the amendments that are intended to improve the Commission's proposals in line with the rapporteur's proposals.
It is not often on the Committee on International Trade that we can say that, and that we have that sort of consensus across the parties.
His proposal is to produce a more effective system that better responds to the interests of beneficiary countries, to develop rules for a better regulated reform process, to ensure that regulation is in line with democratic control and parliamentary scrutiny, to bring the GSP scheme into line with the WTO and the Doha Round, and also to improve the transparency of GSP.
In this spirit, I would like to urge my colleagues to support a cross-party global campaign calling for real trade, of which I am the co-chairman with Abdi Abdirahman, the Speaker of the East African Legislative Assembly.
We call for five things: let us abolish agricultural subsidies; let us abolish agricultural tariffs; let us liberalise rules of origin; let us stop supporting corrupt governments through direct budgetary support and place more emphasis on aid for trade, so that we can invest in things like infrastructure; and let us incentivise low-income countries to remove barriers between each other.
However, we should also call on governments of poorer countries to consider doing the same for basic essentials.
It is morally wrong for poor people to pay more for food and medicines because of government import tariffs.
Yes, the EU should open up its markets, but this good work is often undermined if other governments restrict access and keep prices high purely for ideological reasons.
So, we should all work together to fight trade tariffs that condemn the poor.
We should end government subsidies that incentivise tyranny, and we should always be a friend of those who want to work their way out of poverty, because with our help they will end world hunger.
<d>
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Audy on the top quality report he has produced, both in terms of the ideas contained therein and the proposals it makes.
In actual fact, customs, as the report explicitly says, are a multifunctional tool nowadays.
They play a fiscal role, their original role, but they also play an economic role and an ever increasing role in terms of protecting the security of European businesses and European consumers.
From an economic point of view, they naturally have to facilitate international trade and the European Union has every interest in seeing this happen.
Yet they also have to focus on their security role, in terms of thwarting and fighting against counterfeiting and piracy, combating situations of totally unfair competition that undermine some European businesses, especially in weaker sectors and in terms of protecting the environment and public health, which are assets that our communities are increasingly coming to appreciate.
This is why we need to make more headway.
The proposal outlined by the rapporteur is, in our view, a good one, as it follows the line of promoting harmonisation of the customs system.
We have a community trade policy and a community customs policy, but we then have a series of national administrations that do not always work together in the most appropriate way.
To ensure that the interests of European producers and consumers are protected, it would be advantageous if we could progress more quickly towards harmonisation.
Progress through new practices, establishing better coordination and creating conditions for the effective harmonisation of customs administration at Community level.
We shall therefore be doing European citizens a good service, both from the viewpoint of producers and consumers.
There is also an issue that I believe to be very important and that relates to small and medium-sized enterprises, and that is also addressed in the report and was tackled by the previous speaker.
Our small and medium-sized enterprises are particularly vulnerable in situations where we fall prey to unfair competition and our customs system is not always ready to deal successfully with such risks.
We therefore need to invest heavily in this and improve coordination with small and medium-sized enterprises themselves.
They are not always experts on the rules and procedures, and are therefore at a disadvantage in terms of their ability to access international trade.
I shall end as I began, by congratulating the author of this report, that I believe has done Europe a service in this specific and very important field of the customs system.
<d>
rapporteur. - (NL) Madam President, I am pleased that today speakers have discussed not only unbundling but also consumer rights.
Looking ahead to Thursday's vote, I should just like to request support for three amendments seeking to further improve these consumer rights and to inform consumers regularly about their consumption.
I do not think it too much to ask that this be done four times a year.
There is also the concept of smart meters and the imposition of a deadline for their roll-out, namely 10 years after the entry into force of the Directive.
Finally, on the subject of the national action plans to tackle energy poverty, I should just like to say to Mr Vidal-Quadras that we are only citing the social tariffs as an example to Member States of a possible instrument.
These are three amendments for which we request support in order to improve consumer rights.
To conclude, Madam President, I am disappointed with the Commissioner's response, in which he leaves the areas of consumer rights to Member States in the name of subsidiarity.
I would say to him that we are moving towards a European market in energy, and so tomorrow British citizens will be faced with a German supplier.
As I see it, this European market in energy means that we must also be able to give consumers a European answer.
<d>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, let me first extend my gratitude to the Fisheries Committee and especially to its rapporteur, Mrs Fraga, for her report.
This revised protocol has set the fishing possibilities and the financial contribution for the period 1 August 2010 to 31 July 2012.
It is the result of a long and complex negotiation process between the European Commission and Mauritania that was launched in October 2007, following serious under-utilisation of the protocol by European ship-owners, namely under-utilisation for cephalopods and the small pelagic species.
The main changes introduced in the new protocol are, firstly, related to the duration of the protocol, which we have extended from two to four years, and, secondly, a reduction of the fishing possibilities for cephalopods, following scientific advice, and for small pelagics, following the actual utilisation and the forecasts for the European Union fleet.
Thirdly, an overall reduction of the financial contribution over a four-year period, from an average of EUR 86 million per year to an average of EUR 72.25 million per year, but with an increase within this allocation of the part dedicated to supporting the country's fisheries policy: from EUR 11 million per year in 2008-9 to EUR 20 million per year in 2011-2012.
Fourthly, there is a revised procedure for dealing with infringements in Mauritanian waters.
This is a well-balanced protocol which conciliates the different interests: the need to adjust the EU financial contribution to reduced fishing possibilities for the EU fleet, and the importance of giving greater support to the fisheries sector in Mauritania so as to encourage the integration of this sector into the Mauritanian National Development strategy.
The Fisheries Partnership Agreement contributes 20% of the budgetary revenues of the Mauritanian state, compared to approximately 30-35% in the period 2004-2005.
The Fisheries Partnership Agreement amounts to 80% of the overall revenues from the fisheries sector within the state budget.
The European Community fishing effort in the Mauritanian EEZ represents 20% of the overall effort - that is both artisanal and industrial fleets.
During the negotiations, the Mauritanian side asked the Commission to make every effort to pay the first annual financial contribution by the end of August 2008.
This contribution is crucial for the Mauritanian national budget considering, as I said earlier, that annual payments under the Fisheries Partnership Agreement represent 15 to 20% of the country's budget.
It is also of vital importance for EU operators in the region whose activities may suffer in the event of non-payment before that date - that is due to non-ratification on the Community side.
I would also like to make reference to the question of relative stability, which was also raised by one of the Member States during the June Council, and to remind you that the Commission has no legal obligation to apply the previous allocation of fishing possibilities (i.e. relative stability) under the Fisheries Partnership Agreement, that is agreements which have a financial compensation, such as the one we are considering today.
This is because it needs to guarantee that the allocation reflects the best possible option for ensuring value for money (i.e. optimisation of the utilisation for the financial contribution).
Under these agreements, fishing possibilities should be allocated according to other criteria such as the utilisation rate of the previous protocol, the Member States' requests during negotiations and historical fishing possibilities allocated to the Member States and also the situation / capacity of the fleet.
<d>
(FR) Mr President, right now I would like to ask you about the position of the French Presidency regarding linguistic diversity.
Diversity is a founding principle of Europe.
All the languages in the world are part of humanity's heritage, and it is the duty of public institutions to take action to protect them.
(ES) Mr President, the Council conclusions of 22 May on multilingualism invited the Commission to draw up a detailed framework on this subject, which it has announced that it will do by the autumn.
What will the position and actions of the French Presidency be regarding the multilingualism policy?
What is the Presidency's position going to be and what role does it intend to give to the non official EU languages, which are also called 'regional' and 'minority' languages?
Because, Mr President, as we await the vote in the French Senate next week, France is currently a very bad example to all those of us who believe that linguistic diversity is a common heritage of all Europeans.
(The speaker continued his speech in Basque)
<d>
Mr President, I support democratic Georgia's right to seek security in the west and I disapprove of Russia's disproportionate aggression and continued occupation of the country.
The EU must increase its aid to Georgia for reconstruction, fast-track an EU free trade agreement and press ahead with visa facilitation.
Georgia should also be allowed to go on the path for NATO, eventually for full membership.
We must use this opportunity now, through the EU's common external energy security policy, to break Moscow's stranglehold on Europe's oil and gas supplies.
Germany and Italy are both building pipelines in joint ventures with Gazprom.
To balance this, the EU should also support the White Stream pipeline project which will transport gas from the Caspian Sea to Europe through Georgia and Ukraine - both governments supporting this project - thereby circumventing Russia.
Targeting Gazprom's monopoly and Russia's use of the gas weapon as our long-term response will hit Russia hard.
<d>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, let me also begin with a word of thanks to our rapporteurs Mrs Trautmann, Mr Harbour, Mrs del Castillo and Mrs Toia and to all the shadow rapporteurs both for the good work performed by everyone and for their fruitful cooperation with those who were less closely involved with this dossier.
The last legal framework for market liberalisation dates from 2002.
The importance of the market has already been emphasised today.
After all, if I may remind you of a statistic, a turnover of more than EUR 300 billion has been achieved by the telecommunications sector in Europe alone.
Thousands of jobs depend on this market, and so it is important that we continue to develop the legal framework which has stood the test since 2002 in such a way that new chapters can be added to this European success story.
To this end, of course, we must first and foremost adapt our legal framework to take account of new technological developments.
In the brief time that I, too, have been allocated, let me highlight two points that are of particular importance to me personally.
The first is investment in high-tech infrastructure in Europe.
We in Europe face the formidable challenge of investing as much as possible as quickly as possible in these new high-speed broadband networks.
That is one of the keys to a competitive Europe.
We must create the legal conditions in which these investments will bear fruit.
On the other hand, we must not create new monopolies and closed markets.
In committee, we ensured that the risk involved in creating the new networks would be fairly distributed and that regulators would have to take this risk-sharing into consideration in future.
In addition, we devoted a great deal of attention to the subject of frequency policy.
We favour a more flexible frequency policy in Europe.
I believe a good way can be found to share out the digital dividend so as to take account of broadcasters' legitimate interests while providing as much flexibility as possible for new services too.
<d>
Mr President, it is no accident that the term 'sanctions' stands undefined in international law.
This is an instrument of pressure that is difficult to capture precisely.
Consequently the rapporteur's ambitious proposals to harmonise the principles of use of sanctions are even harder to achieve.
They could also be counter-productive.
Sanctions are an indispensable instrument of EU foreign policy.
In view of the EU's broad competences in trade and border control, they are of considerable importance for implementing objectives in the spheres of both security and the defence of human rights.
This is why sanctions are part of our foreign policy instrument palette, and this is why we do not shirk from applying them in a fairly free and, at times, inappropriate way.
Instead of subjecting sanctions to some kind of rigid set of rules, we should, in the name of the efficacy of our impact on world politics, leave their application to sagacious political evaluation.
With this general reservation, our political group supports the report.
<d>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (LT) Good fences make good neighbours.
That is an old English saying.
Today, thinking about neighbouring countries, it would be more appropriate to say that low fences or no fences are better.
At the juncture of the 20th and 21st centuries, with increasing tendencies towards authoritarianism, Belarus became the odd sick man of Europe.
The country slid into self-isolation and isolation, as the fences surrounding it grew ever higher.
Due to human rights abuses there was no place in the European Council for a state at the centre of Europe.
Last year gave us hope that relations between the European Union and Belarus can change and that the fences I mentioned can be lowered.
Here mention has been made of the small steps which Minsk has taken in the right direction in terms of political prisoners, the registration of parties and the registration of newspapers.
We might also mention the future opening of a European Union representation.
I share the cautious optimism of both the Commission Member and the Minister and feel that the skies are clearing, but that there are still many clouds.
Here our colleague Mr Protasiewicz has already mentioned both media freedom and real conditions allowing the formation of political parties, and the country is generally also on the brink of great economic and social changes.
Reforms should look to the future and make the lives of ordinary people easier.
I think that the European Union should also go down the road of mutual understanding.
Firstly by destroying or at least lowering the financial fences of visa requirements, which prevent people from communicating so much.
Belarus has taken the decision to build a new nuclear power plant which will probably appear quite close to Lithuania's capital Vilnius.
Several such power plants are planned for the region in Lithuania, Estonia and Poland.
There needs to be dialogue among all these and other states and constant consultations, so that we avoid misunderstandings, damage to the environment and disregard for the interests of other countries.
Brussels should watch carefully how Minsk implements the IAEA's recommendations, conventions on nuclear security, and defend the interests of European Union countries.
I do not think that Belarus will make any real progress unless the wall between official institutions and people there is torn down.
The government should be interested in talking to and negotiating with the opposition, NGOs, unions and youth organisations.
In a few months the European Parliament will submit recommendations as to whether we should continue tearing down that fence, or build an even higher one.
If we fail to take advantage of this chance, people on both sides will be disillusioned.
The ball, as they say, is in Minsk's court.

author. - Mr President, I am delighted that you follow the Mediterranean diet and see it is very successful for you!
What this morning has shown me here, as the Chair of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, is that we have a very varied range of subjects to talk about.
One minute we are talking about animal transport - a very important subject - and now we are talking about another very important subject: the Mediterranean diet.
One of the jobs that has come to me, as Chair of the Committee on Agriculture, and which we are particularly trying to get to grips with, is that, on the occasion of the Council of Ministers held in Brussels on 16 July 2007, the Commission reiterated its full support for the nomination of the Mediterranean diet as Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO.
This nomination will be examined in 2009 - in fact, it now has been - by the responsible UNESCO committee.
Is the Commission planning to set up a specific and coordinated strategy to support this nomination, because we are moving on very fast now?
I represent, as I said, the Committee on Agriculture here, but I probably represent all Members when we talk about diet, because one of the great things about Europe is its diversity and culture and part of that diversity and culture is, of course, our food.
The Mediterranean diet is a very good one.
What is the Mediterranean diet?
I am sure we could talk a great deal about that this morning, but it is generally a diet rich in oily fish, olive oils, fruit and vegetables.
It is without doubt a very tasty diet, and you can see by the size of me that I am a very big fan of it.
It is also a healthy diet: it is a rich source of essential fatty acids and antioxidants, a combination that can help improve cholesterol levels and protect heart health.
Recent medical research has also suggested it may help cut the risk of conditions such as dementia.
When you go to Mediterranean countries, you can see that people enjoy it, and not only those who live there but also many of us who travel to Mediterranean countries, especially when we want some sunshine and also some very good food.
It is something that we need to take seriously in a world where everything seems to be uniform.
We see the new generations being bombarded by the fast-food chains - I will not name them all here today - which are spreading throughout the European Union.
We should remember that, yes, there is a role for a fast-food chain, but it would be a terrible thing if, in years to come, all we found when we travelled through Europe was fast food.
Travelling through parts of America - especially on the west coast - there seems to be nothing but fast-food chains, and that is the last thing we want here in the European Union.
As I said, we need to support Mediterranean food, and it is a very good idea for culture and diversity.
I think that in the future, we will have to look at other forms of diet across the European Union, because what I want to say to you quite clearly this morning is that while I am a great supporter of the Mediterranean diet, I do not come here as the Chair of the Committee on Agriculture just to support the Mediterranean diet, because there are other diets across Europe that are equally as good but have different qualities and different food.
So this is the start of many things to come and, as I said, I really want to know from the Commission how it intends to actively support this bid throughout this year, because we are looking forward to an award for the Mediterranean diet and we are also looking forward to having some very good Mediterranean food in the future.

Madam President, I welcome this debate and, in line with the accompanying motion for a resolution, I encourage all EU Member States to sign and ratify the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse.
I also urge all EU Member States to sign up to the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography.
The Council of Europe Convention is the first international legal instrument to categorise the various forms of sexual abuse of children as criminal offences, including such abuse perpetrated with the use of force, coercion or threats, even within the family.
However, seven EU Member States have still not signed this Convention, and eight Member States have still to ratify the UN Optional Protocol.
The Internet is increasingly being used by potential and actual sex offenders as a medium for the sexual abuse of children, in particular, through grooming and child pornography.
While I accept that Irish criminal law protecting children against sexual abuse and exploitation is quite comprehensive, I would, nevertheless, urge the Irish Government to bring forward up-to-date legislation as soon as possible to deal with the proliferation of new ways by which children can be subject to sexual abuse.

Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I take due note of Mr Cottigny's report on what is an important directive which consolidates at European level a fundamental social right of employees.
The Commission attaches great importance to informing and consulting employees at both national and transnational level, particularly in the current difficult context of the financial crisis.
We proposed the recasting of the directive on European work councils.
This has been successfully completed.
We are continuing our work on the anticipation and socially responsible management of restructuring and the questions arising at European level from the negotiation of transnational agreements.
As explained in its communication of 17 March 2008, the Commission's prime concern for the implementation of Directive 2002 / 14 / EC is that it should be comprehensive and effective in collaboration with the Member States and the two sides of industry, which have an extremely important role to play, as you know.
It should be borne in mind that the directive only establishes a general framework that can be implemented and expanded by the two sides of industry, particularly at company level.
The Commission conducts and supports activities for raising awareness, promoting the exchange of best practices and boosting the capacities of all the parties involved by means of seminars, training courses, studies and financial aid for projects particularly under a specific budget line.
The Commission also monitors the correct application of the directive in its capacity as Guardian of the Treaties: for example, if complaints are made by trade union organisations.
So far, however, the Commission has received very few complaints concerning the implementation of this directive.
<d>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission welcomes Parliament's initiative to formulate an own-initiative opinion on the social economy.
Especially in the context of the present financial and economic crisis, this important sector deserves to be promoted more.
Social economy enterprises have a unique way of doing business since they combine economic performance mutually between members, and often also the achievement of social and societal objectives, as a business purpose.
Thus, they are well placed to contribute to Community policies and objectives, particularly in the field of employment, social cohesion, regional and rural development, environmental protection, consumer protection and social security.
Social economy enterprises are an integral part of the Commission's enterprise policy.
Since, in the majority, they are micro, small or medium-sized enterprises, they already benefit from the Small Business Act and all actions targeting small enterprises.
With regard to the social economy, our objective is to create a legal and administrative environment, at European level and in every Member State, in which social economy enterprises of whatever form and size can thrive and meet the challenges posed by globalisation and the economic downturn.
More specifically, the Commission's policy aims to guarantee that social economy enterprises can grow and prosper alongside other forms of company.
To this end, the Commission pays particular attention to ensuring that all other Community policies in areas such as competition, accounting, company law, public procurement, health, social affairs, agriculture, fisheries, banking, insurance, public and private partnerships and regional development, do take into account the specific needs, particular goals, efforts and working style of this kind of enterprise.
To conclude, the Commission services are currently working on a document which will take stock of the progress made since 2004 on the promotion of cooperatives.
It will also assess the situation of other social economy enterprises and propose new actions if necessary.
<d>
- (SK) The basic logic of the European Parliament's budget structure, as proposed by the Budget Committee rapporteur Vladimír Maňka, is sound.
It includes provision for those points which have proven to be weaker and not fully thought out or not implemented to a sufficient extent in previous years.
First and foremost this involves finally sorting out the translation and interpreting resources used in the European Parliament.
Despite expectations we have fallen well short here of securing full implementation of one of the basic axioms of the European Union, which is equality of access and freedom from linguistic discrimination.
And I am not thinking only of equal access and freedom from discrimination in relation to the activities of MEPs, but especially the possibility for EU citizens, regardless of their mother tongue, to access information on activities and outcomes of debates at the institution citizens send their representatives to through direct elections.
Although we have had a massive expansion of the European Union, a delay of five years really does look like an absurd play for time.
This undermines faith in European institutions, especially in the smaller countries, and creates fertile ground for nationalist political groups.
<d>
in writing. - I believe that gender inequality should be phased out of our lives.
In today's civilised world, the disparity between men and women, and majorities and minorities, must be done away with.
The European Parliament must observe its past legislation and uphold the values of universal solidarity.
There must be a gender mix in the decision-making process for the performing arts and various other areas.
In order to find true talent, the most capable performers and deserving applicants, women must be given equal status with men in the same fields.
Where men are favoured over women, or vice versa, there must be serious corrections and viable protection to end this inconsistency.
Depriving a group on the basis of sex or any other characteristic will not be tolerated by the EU, and it is our duty to ensure this applies across the field of the performing arts (and others areas as well).
For this reason, it is my duty and that of the PPE-DE Party to give a vote of confidence to any legislation that supports equality, corrects wrongdoings, and better preserves cohesion between members of the opposite sex.
<d>
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission welcomes the opportunity, a few days after International Women's Day on 8 March, to make a declaration before the European Parliament on childcare facilities for pre-school age children.
These facilities are essential for promoting gender equality and for helping to achieve a work-life balance, but also for ensuring quality of life for children.
At a meeting of the European Council in Barcelona in 2002, the Member States adopted ambitious aims which were to be fulfilled by 2010.
In line with the undertaking which the Commission accepted before the European Parliament in 2007, a report on the implementation of the Barcelona objectives was presented in October 2008.
In the report, the Commission spoke about why it is important to invest more in childcare facilities.
The Commission noted mainly that the Barcelona objectives are aimed at eliminating obstacles to accessing the labour market, especially for women.
More than 6 million women in the EU (aged from 25 to 49) say that they are unable to work or can work only part-time because of family obligations.
The European economy is thereby deprived of significant productive potential, and this at a time when it must confront serious economic and demographic challenges, and when the social position of families is thereby weakened.
The development of childcare facilities for pre-school age children will enable families to decide freely how to organise their time and how to achieve a better work-life balance.
The aim is not to 'force' parents to send their children to these facilities. The aim is to offer this option to parents who want it.
The development of childcare services will also contribute to the prevention of poverty, especially for single-parent families, more than a third of whom face the threat of poverty.
In connection with the demographic slowdown which Europe is going through, access to childcare facilities will also assist in the implementation of family planning.
It turns out that the Member States with the highest birth rates are precisely those which have introduced the most highly-developed policies on the work-life balance and which record the highest levels of employment of women.
Childcare facilities also contribute to children's development, of course.
Numerous studies, especially those carried out by the OECD and UNICEF, have shown that these services play a significant role in the personal development of children, provided that they are of a high quality and children are entrusted to them for adequate periods of time.
Childcare services can also have a positive influence on educational results and future professional life.
The Commission states in its report that despite all of the aforementioned good reasons, most Member States are far from achieving the objectives set out in 2002.
A lot of work remains to be done, especially concerning children under three years old.
Furthermore, there are some facilities operating only for part of the working day, which restricts parents' access to the labour market.
The Commission recognises, however, that significant progress has been achieved in many Member States.
The undertakings adopted by Member States at a European level and the appeals expressed by the European Parliament in a series of resolutions have played an important role in this regard.
It is therefore necessary for all of the participants, especially the national and regional bodies, to come together and create progressive, financially accessible and high-quality childcare facilities for pre-school age children.
In the Plan for Achieving Gender Equality, the European Commission undertook to support the efforts being made by Member States in this area.
It encourages the Member States to make full use of the possibilities offered by the structural funds.
With the aim of assisting local organisations to introduce measures in this area, the Commission has adopted an information brochure in addition to last year's one on the possibilities for financing family support measures.
The Commission will continue to support the exchange of proven approaches and will regularly monitor the Barcelona objectives within the framework of the strategy for growth and employment.
It will also evaluate family policies, especially policies on the work-life balance, in which it will rely mainly on cooperation with the OECD.
Last but not least, the Commission will support adherence to European childcare objectives within the framework of the strategy for growth and employment after 2010.
Some people may be questioning the wisdom of investing in childcare facilities at a time of crisis.
Nevertheless, numerous studies have shown that where such services are not available, everyone pays the price.
It is therefore important to act today in order to ensure access to childcare facilities and in order to support employment and to promote equality, social inclusion and the interests of children.
<d>
Mr President, before I go further I would just like to pay tribute to the rapporteur, Mrs Morgan.
I know she is about to leave this place and, though we do not always agree on issues, I think everyone will agree that she has done a tremendous amount of work on this report.
We all know, if we look at the history of liberalisation in the EU, that telecoms liberalisation has been a great success, offering choice, lower prices and better services to consumers right across the EU.
It is a shame that the postal market and the energy market, in particular, have lagged behind in this respect.
This is certainly a few steps in the right direction, but we still need to sort out the problem of network unbundling and also access to other markets.
It is not right that some markets, such as the UK market, remain open to competition, whereas companies in Germany and France are able to access the UK market, yet prevent companies from the UK and other countries accessing their own market.
The time for protectionism is over.
It is time to have more faith in the market.
<d>
(PL) Listening to my fellow speakers, I wonder whether the citizens of the European Union are doomed to merely listen to our words.
It is something we could have tested in January of this year, during the energy crisis.
After all, we are adopting resolutions as we all feel that the Union is not coping with the issue of energy security.
We also note, Commissioner, that there is less interest in Nabucco among the EU Member States, although this is not the case for all energy projects. In the north, we have the Nord Stream project, which is a very serious move against the common foreign policy.
In the south, there is the South Stream project.
Here, too, the EU Member States are keen to get involved.
However, when it comes to Nabucco, all we hear are promises, but there is neither sufficient money nor political support.
While we are discussing the subject in Strasbourg, the cement mixers have arrived on the shores of the Baltic to work on the Nord Stream project.
I would like to know whether I can hold supporters of the Treaty of Lisbon to their word, namely that when the Treaty is ratified, they will cease to support the Nord Stream and South Stream projects.
Nabucco may prove to be an excellent step towards ensuring energy security.
If we continue to merely issue statements then, during future energy crises, when we send EU citizens pamphlets containing our resolutions, they will burn them.
<d>
(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have drawn up a major resolution which covers a number of themes.
However, one important point - trade - is only touched on briefly.
I believe that international trade is a decisive factor.
The fall in world trade is one of the causes of the economic and financial crisis and I would like to see a greater focus on world trade, even now in the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC).
It is not the case that the US and the European Union agree on every area.
On the contrary, we have only a few trade agreements, there is a risk of bilateralism and there is the possibility that the Doha Development Round will not be continued by the US.
Therefore, we should address the critical points and I hope that the TEC will introduce some new stimuli to revive international trade.
<d>
The Commission's and the governments' measures for the crisis in the livestock farming sector go hand in glove with the more general anti-grassroots CAP and, more importantly, the decision taken by the EU on the full liberalisation of the dairy market.
The most serious thing is that the proposed headings are being used to speed up restructurings to boost the profits of the food industry, thereby strengthening the business groups of the dairy sector at the expense of livestock farmers.
The measures do not address the acute problems that small and medium-sized dairy farm owners have been demonstrating against: namely, the high costs of production and derisory producer prices.
More to the point, they do not address the acute problems of all livestock farmers, in cattle breeding, in meat production and in sheep- and goat-farming.
Industrialists and merchants are doubling their profits, both from derisory producer prices and from the exponential prices paid by workers for these staple foodstuffs.
We voted against the proposal, because its objective is to further concentrate production in this sector.
The solution for poor and medium-sized farm owners is to fight against the monopoly-friendly policy of the EU and for a different type of development which liberates livestock farmers from exploitation, guarantees them an income and future and generally serves the nutritional needs and well-being of the people.
<d>
(RO) I very strongly appreciate what has been said by Mr Reinfeldt and I welcome, in particular, the fact that the European Union reached a common position for the Copenhagen conference at the European Council in October.
The European Union has already adopted, off its own bat, robust measures for combating climate change, making progress towards cutting greenhouse gas emissions.
However, it is obvious that the European Union's solo effort cannot guarantee absolute success at the international negotiations.
I believe that it is extremely important for the European Union to make the transition to a reduction target of more than 20% only while retaining certain conditions, without which we consider that the EU's effort would be excessive.
The conditions ought to relate, in particular, to the mandatory legal nature of the future agreement.
In addition, specific targets for cutting emissions should be adopted by the developed countries on a par with those adopted by the EU, along with the corresponding contributions from the developing countries.
<d>
(PL) Mr President, proper implementation of the Directive on services in the internal market is important not only for European entrepreneurs operating in that market, but also for consumers.
The Services Directive is a good example.
A period of three years has been allowed for its implementation.
That is a long time, but even so, not all countries will manage to transpose the directive within the three years.
This example shows most conspicuously that ideal cooperation between Member States and European institutions is needed in order to achieve transposition in time in all Member States.
Indeed, this is the direction taken in the recommendations issued by the Commission in June this year concerning means for improving the functioning of the internal market.
I think that in the implementation process, it is necessary to go a little further.
Therefore, in the report concerning the table of results for the internal market, I propose the initiative of organising a forum for the internal market, which would bring together representatives of European institutions, Member States and other interested groups with the aim of achieving a more explicit commitment to transposition, so that we will be able to apply and execute legislation on the internal market, including this extremely important directive.
I would like the forum to be a place for the exchange of experience of Member States and EU institutions in the area of transposition.
I would like the forum to draw the attention of society to questions concerning the internal market.
We must increase our citizens' interest in the functioning of and responsibility for the market.
Then we will have achieved complete success.
In connection with the problems which we heard about a moment ago concerning transposition of the Services Directive, I would like to ask if Member States have sought to cooperate with the Commission, and if it can be said that in the implementation process, they have succeeded in applying any of the Commission's recommendations?
Does the Commission continue to seek new solutions?
Is it making use of all possibilities and means to mobilise and support especially those countries which are experiencing problems with transposition?
Are there any new ideas on this matter?
<d>
(ES) Madam President, while illegal fishing in the Indian Ocean may be occurring, the Community fleet can certainly not be described as illegal, as has been suggested here.
The Community fleet fishes within the strictest bounds of legality, with licences issued under the European Community - Seychelles Fisheries Partnership Agreement and the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC), which regulates and manages tuna fishing in the area.
Secondly, all Community vessels are equipped with a satellite monitoring system, through which they can be located in real time and at all times by the fishing and military authorities.
Thirdly, the Community fleet has observers on board and complies with a strict regime of providing information on fishing activity through fishing logbooks, catch samples and a ban on transferring goods at high sea, among other measures.
Lastly, the entire Community fleet has been duly entered in the IOTC regional fleet register.
I personally would like both the Commission and the Council to acknowledge that the European fleet fishing in that area is doing so within the strictest bounds of legality.
<d>
There are certainly a great many positive things to say today.
For the second time in a row, we can speak of an unqualified opinion on the accounts.
The level of the irregularities is decreasing.
The traffic light system, whose lights all used to be on red, is gradually showing more and more amber, yellow and, in particular, green.
These are all positive aspects.
Another positive aspect is agriculture, which used to be a real source of concern.
For years on end, we have regarded IACS - the system ensuring common management of agricultural expenditure - as a good system.
We had seen Member States such as Greece failing to take part.
These are obviously all things that are moving in the right direction.
All the same, there are sources of concern.
These include cohesion, research and development, energy, transport, and the whole chapter on external aid, development and enlargement.
In my opinion, therefore, we must try to select a number of issues for attention from the discharge we are addressing today.
Cohesion will be one such issue.
I would remind the House of the notorious comment in paragraph 6.17 that up to 11% of the expenditure in respect of the Structural Funds, European Regional Development Fund and European Social Fund should not actually have been disbursed.
In my opinion, we must ask the competent Commissioners many questions about this and look at the precise state of affairs.
Then there is external aid, development and enlargement; the whole package of funds that we channel to the United Nations.
Once again, I read in the Annual Report of the Court of Auditors that - like other organisations - the Court has insufficient or even no access to the accounts of the United Nations, which means that large amounts of European funds channelled to this organisation cannot, in fact, be properly controlled.
A third issue to be addressed is the whole system of comanagement.
As the general rapporteur has pointed out, 80% of all European funds are actually spent within the framework of comanagement, by the Member States and the Commission.
We must now, once again, exert pressure on the Member States' finance ministers, in particular, to ensure that they shoulder their responsibility and issue a declaration stating that they have done their jobs properly, that their administration has spent funds correctly, and that this has been subject to controls.
I myself am responsible for own resources on the Committee on Budgetary Control.
The whole VAT dossier continues to cause me concern.
We have published various reports on the subject, including in the previous parliamentary term.
According to estimates, total VAT fraud Europe-wide amounts to EUR 80-100 billion.
The Court of Auditors has made a number of observations on this, too.
Therefore, I should like to devote particular attention to this matter in the discharge.
I should like to finish off by mentioning the discharge for the other institutions.
I myself am rapporteur for Parliament's discharge.
In my opinion, the key issues in this regard should include public procurement procedures, where problems are apparent.
Finally, concerning the Council's discharge, we granted that discharge earlier this week.
This Court of Auditors' report, too, raises some very negative points about the Council.
In my opinion, we must continually exert pressure on the Council to grant access to its accounts such as to allow Parliament to properly control this kind of... (speaker moved away from the microphone) too.
<d>
on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, recent events have once again reminded us all how important it is that we share information in order to ensure the security of EU citizens.
SWIFT has been a valuable tool in achieving this.
Luckily, having met with US Government officials, particularly Mr David Cohen, the Assistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing in the US Treasury Department, recently in Washington, I was reassured by the multi-layered control systems and safeguards and independent oversight which I hope will lead to the implementation of this new agreement being beyond reproach.
Where I must express grave concern, as others have done, is in the Council's substandard consultation with Parliament, and alleged Commission delays.
It is essential that Parliament and the elected representatives of this House are frequently and properly informed, and parliamentary consent must not be a retrospective tool.
For the Council to treat it as such undermines the values and democratic principles that lie at the heart of this Chamber and this Parliament.
I do hope that the Council, and indeed the Presidency, will take careful note of these remarks.
<d>
Madam President, with reference to my speech on 20 January, I am interested in what kind of measures the Turkish Government has implemented, according to the records of the Council and the Commission, to involve the population in the implementation of the democratisation process and the reforms necessary for integration with the European Union.
Turkey's 2009 development report points out shortcomings in the fulfilment of the Copenhagen criteria, with a particular emphasis on political criteria, which include the implementation of democracy and the rule of law, human rights and the protection of the rights of minorities.
In the development report, it was noted that, through the development aid instrument, EUR 567 million have been allocated to Turkey in the past year.
The allocations were, for the most part, aimed at implementing outstanding reforms in the political and justice systems, as well as the development of civil society.
At the same time, it was made clear that the use of these instruments had been decentralised, which means that the Turkish authorities administered the allocated aid, following the Commission's accreditation.
Since they are interested in carrying out the membership negotiations for Turkey as quickly as possible, which means that the current shortcomings need to be resolved, the Council and the Commission should have an accurate synopsis of concrete actions by the Turkish Government carried out in order to achieve this objective.
On its homepage, in visual form, the Commission has indeed put some projects for ending the use of child labour, acquiring a basic education, involving people with disabilities in society, and setting up a confidential line for women in Turkey suffering from domestic violence.
However, are these actions enough to create the necessary grassroots public support for the immediate and successful implementation of the necessary reforms?
In the light of the contents of the development report, what kind of additional urgent measures or projects have been planned to overcome the obstacles that have arisen in problematic areas?
<d>

(FR) Mr President, we in Parliament have been dismayed to learn of the creation of a working group tasked with discussing an 'advanced status' for Tunisia.
Why are we dismayed?
We are dismayed because not a day goes by without reports reaching us from that country illustrating the increase in threats and acts of intimidation against all those men and women who still dare to criticise the methods of that regime.
Without going back over the most recent results of the municipal elections - 90% of the votes were in favour of those close to the seat of power - I shall cite a few examples.
On 6 May, the journalist, Zouhair Makhlouf, was arrested and manhandled by the police while on his way to a dinner with the former president of the Bar of Paris.
On 18 May, the journalist, Fahem Boukadous, will no doubt be sentenced to four years' imprisonment.
What was his crime?
To report on the social unrest in the Gafsa Basin and on the repression that followed it.
The lawyers Abderraouf Ayadi, Ayachi Hammami, Mohamed Abbou and Radhia Nasraoui are the victims of constant intimidation.
The Internet is increasingly being censored.
I shall give one example, Mr President, if I may: my blog is now censored...
(The President cut off the speaker)
<d>
Many procedures are now more direct and more transparent, due to the fact that the Treaty of Lisbon has come into force.
Powers are more clearly defined.
The European Parliament has greater power, and the European Union has boosted its standing both externally and internally.
For the first time in the history of democracy, the citizens of a number of countries have the right to influence events on a supranational level.
In view of the size and diversity of Europe, we must take care that all citizens, including those who are not very wealthy and do not belong to large established organisations, have recourse to all democratic means.
Utilisation of these democratic means must not be dependent on the possession of large financial resources.
The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has a specific financial impact on some European institutions.
During the budget procedure for 2010, it was agreed that we would preferentially use an available reserve in Heading 5 for financing additional costs arising directly from the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon.
Today, therefore, after adopting the original budget for 2010, we are addressing the corresponding additional expenditure via an amending budget.
Following the submission of applications for additional resources, we took every effort to locate reserves and distribute existing resources as far as possible.
The Treaty of Lisbon has a direct or indirect effect on all of the European Parliament's services.
The amending budget of the European Parliament, which we are debating today, will secure the additional financial and human resources to enable Parliament to fulfil its new codecision-making role on an equal footing to that of the Council.
The net financial impact of the amending budget of the European Parliament is lower than the original demand for budgetary resources.
In the conciliation proceedings with the Presidency of the European Parliament, we managed to find EUR 4 million.
There was a further reduction in demand for resources as a result of the timing, as we approved the budget a month later than we originally expected.
Most companies and institutions, not only in Europe but throughout the world, are taking advantage of the global economic crisis to improve their efficiency and competitiveness.
This is the challenge for us, the European Parliament, just as it is for other European institutions.
The Secretary-General of the European Parliament now has further savings and efficiency improvements at his disposal, and not just for this year.
The detailed functional audit at the INLO Directorate-General and in the security service unit, which we agreed on when approving the budget in December, may bring significant and sustainable savings for future budget periods as well.
<d>
(PL) In times of crisis, when the integrity of the European Union is under threat, we should, in supporting economic growth, pay particular attention to the cohesion of the Union.
We still do not know if the crisis will act to deepen the differences between different regions of Europe.
Historical differences in the level of development of regions may grow, and we may also witness the appearance of new differentiating factors.
In this situation, what is particularly needed are mechanisms which reduce differences between regions, and continuation of strong regional policy is the way to achieve this objective.
It would be unwise, in this situation, to give up this policy and reduce significantly the financing available to local and regional authorities, for this would pose a serious threat to the stimulation of economic growth, but would also be a threat to European unity as such.
Both the Europe 2020 strategy and Cohesion policy aim to achieve the same goal.
They have a crucial effect on economic revival and huge significance for European solidarity policy.
However, what is needed is better coordination between them.
Creating new and separate thematic funds to respond to new challenges would be a waste of time and money, and would also delay realisation of the 2020 strategy and condemn it to the fate of the Treaty of Lisbon.
We must ensure the financing of key infrastructure projects and reject the renationalisation of regional policy.
At the moment, we often hear of strong pressure from governments of certain Member States and also from the European Commission to cut or reduce expenditure on regional policy.
However, the message of the European Parliament in the report, of which I was shadow rapporteur, is clear. We need stronger, not weaker, Cohesion policy.
We need true European solidarity.
<d>
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, as I have said on previous occasions, our aim is to ensure that consumers know what they are buying and what they are eating, thus making it easier to choose a diet for themselves and their families in tune with their needs, their wishes and their goals; citizens - consumers - have a right to the right information.
I would appeal to honourable Members to keep this firmly in mind throughout the debate.
Before turning to the substance of the proposal, I would first like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Sommer, for preparing the report, and also the shadow rapporteurs.
Whilst being sympathetic to most of her statements, I cannot say I agree with all of them.
I should also mention the input from other committees, IMCO and AGRI.
Allow me to briefly highlight the most important issues covered by the proposed amendments.
The question of mandatory origin labelling is very important and needs careful assessment.
Indeed, there is a recurrent demand for the mandatory provisions of such information for some foods.
The Commission could partially accept the proposed amendment for an extension of the cases of mandatory origin labelling.
Origin labelling for basic primary foodstuffs which have not undergone substantial processing and are generally considered as single ingredient products could be a pragmatic option.
However, given the complexity of the matter, the application of any mandatory labelling should be subject to the entry into force of delegated measures and be based on impact assessments.
Legibility is a major issue and one of the main complaints that consumers make.
This is a key demonstration that we are putting consumers first in our debate and I hope that honourable Members can support the idea of a minimum font size.
It is thus regrettable that the amendments tabled would undermine the aim of having measurable criteria as a basis for enforcement.
I share the concerns of honourable Members about imitation foods.
I am therefore happy to see Parliament table an amendment containing a provision to explicitly prohibit such misleading practices.
However, the introduction of a definition and specific designation of such products would provoke legal problems, and we therefore need to find those designations which give correct and unambiguous information to the consumer.
I am also pleased to note the broad support for mandatory front-of-pack nutrition labelling and the endorsement of voluntary schemes by Member States.
The principle that consumers should know what they eat should apply not only to prepacked foods but also to food that they buy over the counter or when they eat out.
I am therefore not in favour of amendments which would limit the scope of the draft regulation.
That said, I am open to changing the text on non-prepacked food so that allergen information alone would be mandatory, while Member States could decide on further mandatory requirements for such food.
Turning to the suggestion for mandatory labelling of nano-ingredients, I am pleased to accept the amendment in principle, although there needs to be a suitable definition.
Finally, on the issue of nutrient profiles, let me state that I cannot accept the amendments to delete or modify Article 4 in the proposed way, as this provision would undermine the existing regulation on food claims.
We are all aware that many claims are misleading for consumers; some because they are not substantiated, others because they do not give the full picture of the food in question, claiming only their positive aspects.
It must also be stated that claims are made on the sole initiative of the manufacturer for the purpose of selling more products.
We are not imposing nutrient profiles on anyone.
We are insisting on nutrient profiles where manufacturers choose to market their products through claims, so that consumers can have balanced food information.
The establishment of nutrient profiles does not prohibit or in any way limit the food products that manufacturers can produce.
Food manufacturers can continue to produce whichever way they want to.
However, it is unfair to our consumers and citizens to allow claims that may mislead them.
It is, for me, a question of providing our citizens with honest and full information about the products which they are consuming.
Let us not forget that the Claims Regulation was adopted following in-depth debate amongst the institutions.
The core principles of the regulation remain valid and relevant.
Having said this, I am looking into the establishment of nutrient profiles with an open mind and I am ready to consider positively certain exemptions as they relate to traditional and basic products with an important dietary role.
On this basis, I urge you to support the Commission's endeavours to ensure that we have a meaningful basis to protect consumers and foster innovation in the food sector.
Thank you for your attention.
I now look forward to an interesting debate and hearing your views.
<d>
on behalf of the PPE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to express my sincere thanks to Mrs Sommer for her tough, committed work.
She has been subjected to some baseless criticism that she does not deserve.
That also obscures the fact that there are many matters on which we agree.
We all want better labelling of imitation foods.
Cheese is made of milk, and if it contains other things, then it must be labelled as an imitation on the front of the packaging.
We also all want binding nutritional labelling.
We do not yet have this.
It is something that we all want.
We also all want it to be in a unit that consumers understand.
On this matter, allow me to tell you a joke that is doing the rounds here in Germany - and perhaps in some other countries too: 'What do you call the little animals that sew your clothes tighter while they are in the wardrobe?
Calories. '
Nobody anywhere in Europe would tell this joke using kilojoules.
The kilojoule has not taken off as a unit. It confuses people and therefore, we do not need to specify it as mandatory information.
The calorie is the unit that informed consumers use in their calculations.
There is thus a great deal of agreement.
There are also differences, for example, on the matter of nutritional profiles.
Our group wishes these to be removed, or at least clarification that basic foods will be exempt.
There has been heated discussion over salt in bread, French cheese and similar things.
I would like to thank Commissioner Dalli and President Barroso for having attempted to provide clarification on these matters.
There is no College decision, however, and consequently, we need this to be clarified once and for all.
I would ask you to support the amendments put forward by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) in this area.
<d>
As I said, in all chambers, in all countries, Question Time runs out of time - and we have run out of time.
I am going to take one final question.
Subject: Birds and Habitats Directives
The Birds Directive (79 / 409 / EEC) and the Habitats Directive (92 / 43 / EEC) permanently come under pressure.
It is fashionable to maintain that they stand in the way of economic development.
However, the example of the port of Antwerp demonstrates the contrary.
Almost the whole of the port area is designated as a special protection area under the Birds Directive, but nature conservation and development go hand-in-hand here with economic development, as the Commissioner himself recently ascertained.
Given the pressure which exists to relax these directives, it seems to me appropriate in this Year of Biodiversity to ask the Commissioner what is his position on the Birds and Habitats Directives:
Does the Commissioner agree with President Barroso, who stated in a letter to Prime Minister Balkenende that revision of the aforementioned directives was not needed but, on the contrary, stability in the relevant legislative framework, and that these directives allowed sufficient room for economic development?
<d>
in writing. - (EL) I should like once again to congratulate the rapporteur on this excellent report.
The strategy for the Baltic region inaugurates a new era for functional regions and forms the basis for a more effective response to important challenges by adopting integrated approaches.
The coordination of actions within the framework of various policies with a territorial impact may act as a guide for the future development of cohesion policy.
However, the importance of the strategy is not confined to that.
Its most important aspect is the fact that it was formulated following broad consultation between the interested operators in the area at all levels of governance.
The pillars, the priority sectors and the basic plans of the strategy have not been imposed from on high; they are the natural progression of plans and initiatives developed in the area a long time ago and they respond to the specific daily needs of the citizens.
Within this framework, the importance is highlighted of a partnership between all the operators in a given area, so as to safeguard the best possible results from actions financed using the European taxpayer's money.
It is, in essence, a pilot run for future applications in other functional regions.

(HU) This day, 6 October, is an important date in Hungary's history.
More than 150 years ago, Hungarian revolutionaries took up arms against Europe's two most powerful armies in the name of the fundamental values of liberty, equality and fraternity emerging throughout Europe at the time.
The thirteen generals of the defeated freedom fight were executed on this day in the town of Arad, now located in Romania.
However, the desire of the Hungarian people for freedom was manifested just as powerfully against communism, the twentieth century's oppressive regime, as the events of 1956 amply demonstrated.
Only four of the thirteen martyrs executed in Arad in 1848 were Hungarian, standing as proof that universal values transcend national differences.
For us Hungarians, this symbolises the eternal desire for freedom and the unity of the Hungarian nation, as well as reconciliation and solidarity among nations.
<d>
Madam President, honourable Members, the main objective of the Stability and Growth Pact is to maintain price stability within the European Union.
Under the terms of the treaty, Member States should conduct a national policy that is consistent with the Stability and Growth Pact and the broad economic policy guidelines.
The Council of 7 September agreed on the introduction of the European Semester from 2011.
The main objective of this exercise is to align the timetable for presenting the stability and growth programmes and the national reform programmes, with a view to ensuring consistent structural surveillance at every level of budgetary discipline, macro-economic stability and growth, whilst preserving formally separated individual procedures.
This process will allow for better coordination of economic policies within the European Union and will help to strengthen budgetary discipline, macro-economic stability and growth.
This same concern has led the European Union, in accordance with the powers laid down in the treaty, to envisage measures aimed at promoting the recovery while also ensuring this budgetary discipline.
Europe 2020, the new EU strategy for employment and smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, adopted by the European Council on 17 June, meets this challenge.
Its aim is to change the focus of policies from crisis management to the introduction of medium- and long-term reforms, which specifically promote growth and employment, and which also guarantee the viability of public finances.
As you know, the major objectives identified in the Europe 2020 strategy include an increase in the number of jobs, better conditions for research and development, an improvement in education levels - we touched on this in a previous question - and the promotion of social inclusion, including poverty reduction.
To my mind, therefore, there is no mismatch between a stability pact and measures to restore growth and employment.
<d>
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
Madam President, if you were to visit the Ponte Rialto in Venice - perhaps with Commissioner De Gucht - and wanted to buy a pair of shoes advertised as Italian, a tie, a traditional mask or a glass from Murano, there is a chance you will be ripped off, realising that the product purchased was not made in Italy at all, but in some country in Asia.
I believe that the proposed regulation under discussion is beginning to inject some order into an ever more confused global market.
It seeks to protect the consumer - including you Madam President, and Commissioner De Gucht, if you go shopping on Venice's Ponte Rialto, or elsewhere - as well as the European industries that have not relocated (whilst those that have will be penalised by this regulation).
Above all it will correct the asymmetry on the trade markets, which sees Europe as the only large area lacking a regulation on compulsory origin marking.
This is not a protectionist proposal; in fact, I find it to be very balanced.
It only applies to a limited number of products, to the final product destined for the consumer, and - as far as my group is concerned - it is a 5-year pilot project because we shall support the amendment with the sunset clause.
In addition, we also introduced in committee - through an amendment of my own - a provision that aims to avoid any excessive bureaucratic burden that would harm businesses.
If the vote tomorrow is satisfactory, it will mean that one stage has been won, but it will not be a conclusive victory.
We shall then need the full support of the European Commission in our dealings with the European Council.
The Commission has already been full of suggestions and very cooperative, for which we are grateful, and this is a reason why we must continue to work together.
I am sure that in five years, we shall be satisfied by the result we have obtained.
<d>
President of the Court of Auditors. - Madam President, honourable Members, thank you for all the kind comments that you have addressed to the Court on this occasion, as a tribute also to those who work in our institution each day addressing, with the highest professional standards, and in accordance with international audit standards, the concerns of this institution.
We pay due attention to the recommendations of this House and let me just give you two examples of what we have done in this annual report for 2009 to address the request from this institution for more information.
We provide you with an overall assessment of the situation; for the first time, we say what the overall situation is.
We conclude that it has improved over recent years; the most likely errors for the whole budget are decreasing.
We have also provided you, in particular in the area of cohesion, with more information than last year, because last year we said that at least 11% of the funds should not have been paid; this year, we are able to say that the most likely error estimated is indeed over 5%, which we could not say last year, and that at least 3% of the funds should not have been reimbursed.
This is the measure of the progress we have found.
These are facts.
Why?
What are the reasons behind this?
What progress have we achieved?
We are not inventing facts; we are not being kind to the Commission or kind to the Member States.
The Court is an independent audit institution governed by the treaty.
We base our findings on the evidence and it is what we report to this institution, which we have the obligation to assist in this discharge procedure.
We are willing to assist you in this work and the main reason for this, as we said in our report, is that on the one hand, the systems put in place to manage the funds for this programme period 2007-2013 are performing better.
The other reason is that the disbursement of funds for the programming period is only 25%, so the financial execution for the period is, in our evidence, lower than what should be expected.
So the combination of these two factors - better performance of the systems on the one hand and lower execution, so fewer payments effectively made, on the other - has given us the situation where we now are.
This is where we have this word of caution.
We have to see how things evolve now with the systems behaving so well across all the 27 Member States and with all the funds to be disbursed in the future.
So a word of caution.
But I said that we are willing to assist this House, and particularly the Committee on Budgetary Control, in its discharge.
Our Members will assist you with that and provide you with all the information you need.
But we are also assisting you through our special reports.
You can find audits and other elements which look at the impact of the funding in real life, at how effectively they have been used, and I think that this is very valuable information for this institution also.
Clearly, the responsibility for implementing the budget lies primarily with the European Commission, but the Lisbon Treaty says also in cooperation with the Member States.
If we have to look forward, I would say that we now have a unique opportunity to build a new momentum for a better management of the European Union budget.
A new Financial Regulation is being discussed and will be adopted soon and that will be the basic line to decide and guide the management for future progress.
If we have to have simple rules, if we want to have more efficient, cost-effective systems to manage them through the Member States and within the Commission, that is the moment to address those issues.
The budget review is also on the table next year.
So the Commission, the Council, the European Parliament are therefore confronted now with a period for taking serious decisions to improve the situation in the future.
If the European Court of Auditors can assist in that, I would suggest it should be by building on the recommendations that we have already put forward in our opinion on the key risks and challenges for improving the financial management of the Union.
When you look to the new generation of programmes for the period after 2013, I repeat, we have to ask: are the programmes of funding schemes likely to add value to the European Union?
Are we putting forward schemes which are simple, with clear objectives, realistic to execute and whose accountability lines are clear?
We want to avoid the uncertainty where we are sometimes claiming that there is no responsibility either on the side of the Commission or on the side of the Member States.
We have the opportunity now and the Court of Auditors is looking forward to assisting you in this task.
<d>
- (FR) Mr President, in the history of parliaments, rarely have powers been given to them.
When parliaments were offered more powers, they generally took them.
This morning's debate leads me to believe that we - the rapporteurs of the economic governance package - are right to go further than what is being proposed, because, Commissioner, in substance, the Commission is telling us' We tried but we did not succeed. '
The Council, for its part, is telling us' We do not want to go any further. '
Well, as it happens, there's Parliament.
Furthermore, it is the Council that wanted to increase the rights of Parliament, it is not Parliament that is exercising powers unduly.
Under the Treaty of Lisbon, we are colegislators.
So, I simply have the pleasure of announcing that the report I am tabling this morning also covers eurobonds, because the debate must take place here, in plenary.
I do not accept it when Mr Barroso tells us' Oh la la, it's all very complicated; we have already done a lot of stupid things in the Council, so now you really do have to shut up. '
We are going to do exactly the opposite.
We are going to talk about it within the context of democracy.
Secondly, there is also the idea of a European Monetary Fund, because, in fact, all these solutions which, as Martin Schulz said, are transitional, are not necessarily what our citizens expect.
You can watch the trains go by or you can work.
This Parliament is going to try to work.
We do not have a blueprint, we do not claim to have the absolute truth, but I think it is totally unacceptable that the debate is taking place in the Financial Times or in the Zeit and not in the European Parliament.
So we will do our work.
<d>
(PL) Madam President, four years ago I was an observer at elections to the Palestinian Authority, and I do mean the Palestinian Authority.
I remember the illusory opinion of one of the more important people in the European Parliament.
That person said to me: 'Why, the people from Hamas are basically nice, cultured, friendly people.
Perhaps we should negotiate with them. '
Today, I hear the same.
I hear, today, that perhaps we should negotiate with the moderate Taliban.
Only, the question arises - who are the moderate Taliban, and is this not too flexible a concept?
I would caution against taking such a line.
It is clear that a great many soldiers are being killed in Afghanistan - including soldiers from my country, from Poland - far too many of these soldiers are being killed, our strategy is costing too much money, and NATO's strategy is also questionable.
However, I would not throw the baby out with the bathwater, and I warn against dialogue with people who in reality have objectives which are completely different objectives from ours.
<d>
(PL) Mr President, adoption can, and often does, work for the good of the child, but the procedures related to adoption can also give rise to abuses, such as the trafficking of children and taking children for adoption from families which have not abandoned their children at all, but which often, because of poverty, are not able to give their children the right environment.
The high number of children in orphanages, which we are talking about in today's debate, often does not mean children who have been abandoned, but in fact represents children of poor parents who are not coping with their difficult personal situation.
Such families should be helped.
State authorities could help these families for far lower sums without placing the children in an orphanage at all and without then giving them up for adoption.
We should adopt an unequivocal principle - it should be obligatory in the European Union - never take children from their families because of poverty.
Give help, and do not take children from their families.
Poverty must not be the reason for depriving a child of its biological family.
<d>
Mr President, I will speak for four minutes and keep the remaining two minutes for the end of the debate.
Mr President, Mrs Győri, Commissioner, finally we can see the light at the end of the tunnel on this subject, which is extremely important for patients.
We could no longer remain in a confused situation in which the law was decreed by the Court of Justice of the European Union.
The directive now sets clear rules for the mobility of patients within Europe.
What type of treatment can one receive abroad?
How and based on what criteria can one be reimbursed?
How are the responsibilities shared between the Member State of affiliation and the Member State of treatment?
All the answers to these questions now appear in the draft directive.
Allow me, first and foremost, to thank the Belgian Presidency for its excellent work throughout the negotiations.
Its capacity to convince played a decisive role, because it must be stressed that several Member States did not want this directive.
I think that was a question of irresponsibility.
I would also like to pay tribute to my friend and former Member, Mr Bowis, who is in the gallery.
As the rapporteur at first reading, he was also involved in creating this directive, and has always fought for patients' rights.
I would, of course, also like to thank Commissioner Dalli, and my fellow shadow rapporteurs, who all made a very active contribution to the conclusion of the negotiations, and without whom nothing would have been possible.
What is at stake here for patients?
Medical progress means that healthcare can no longer be provided locally for all diseases and that sometimes, it must be provided across borders.
This may be the case for patients who live in border regions, where healthcare provided abroad is sometimes closer than that provided in their own country.
It may also be due to the fact that there are more resources and expertise available in another Member State, such as for certain highly specialised treatments.
Finally, for some Europeans, it may quite simply be more practical to receive healthcare outside their country of affiliation because they have family living in another Member State.
Consumers, employees, students and now patients will be able to benefit from mobility rights within the Union thanks to clear legislation.
The idea is not, of course, to encourage any sort of medical tourism, as social security systems, their organisation and their management remain the full responsibility of the Member States.
Patients will now generally be able to receive all the healthcare to which they are entitled at home in another Member State, and be reimbursed up to the level of costs assumed by their own system.
For hospital treatment involving an overnight stay or using specialised or cost-intensive technology, the Member State may establish a prior authorisation system.
This will mean that the needs for planning and investment by the Member States in their healthcare structure can be taken into consideration.
Parliament has succeeded in ensuring that the conditions for refusing prior authorisation are limited and set out in an exhaustive list, in order to give patients legal certainty.
Parliament has made progress on other points, too: each Member State will have to establish national contact points to provide patients with the best possible information and guidance based on their needs.
Each national contact point will act as a one-stop shop and must cooperate with the other national contact points.
This will mean that patients receive clear and accurate information.
The issue of reimbursement, which is, in fact, a fundamental obstacle, has been greatly improved, and either a compensation mechanism can be used, as is currently the case with Regulation (EC) No 883 / 2004 on social security, or the patient will have to pay up front and be reimbursed as quickly as possible.
We also ultimately succeeded in ensuring that patients suffering from rare diseases do not have to fend for themselves so much, and can access external expertise to diagnose the disease and help ensure that prior authorisation for healthcare is granted.
I will conclude by saying that, thanks to European cooperation in areas such as the European reference networks, patients will have access to highly specialised care, the aim being to encourage the sharing of experiences in order to improve performance, diagnosis and treatment in the interests of patients.
This is why we can say to ourselves today that we have achieved our goal, and once again I would like to thank all my fellow Members.
I could say that what is being built through this directive is the Europe of health.

The countries of the former socialist bloc understand the political situation in Belarus very well - restrictions on personal freedom and on freedom of the press and the media, and an undemocratic system of government.
In view of the recent events in Belarus following the presidential elections, I would like to draw attention to the steps which the European Parliament will take together with the Commission and the Council to intervene in this matter.
After all, we must talk about measures for helping Belarusian democracy and seek effective ways of reconsidering EU policy towards the Lukashenko regime.
In the present situation, we must put pressure on Minsk and request the release of political prisoners and cessation of the persecution of journalists.
This is why I voted for the adoption of the resolution.
Thank you.

Whether it be in economic terms or in environmental terms, the treatment of waste has become a major issue in this consumer society of ours.
The recycling of waste in Europe has been accorded an important place in this part-session: with the directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment and the resolution on the management of waste in Campania, we have voiced our opinion on a subject that is both technical and political.
No one will be surprised to hear that, every year, we produce more electrical and electronic waste.
The products in question are, in fact, all ones that we use in our everyday lives (telephones, televisions, computers, and so on).
It is estimated that only a third of the 9 million tonnes of electrical and electronic waste produced each year is recycled at present.
The aim of this directive is to increase this rate and to stop wastage, but it is also a question of making producers more responsible.
Indeed, we are calling on the Member States to ensure that producers foot the bill for the collection and treatment of products to be recycled.
Consumers, who already make a significant contribution to waste management, must be supported and assisted in this task by retailers and product sellers.

(GA) Mr President, may I say, firstly, that I am grateful to the group for giving me the opportunity to speak in this debate and may I commend the rapporteur and Commissioner Barnier, in particular, for their excellent and important work.
Since I came into the European Parliament, I have been hearing all the time about the need for more Europe.
I certainly embrace that concept.
The recent economic crisis has brought that idea home to all of us, especially in my own country.
We have an election going on in Ireland at the moment, and it is very interesting that there is more talk about the EU than there is about local issues; this is obviously part of the result of the IMF-EU bail-out.
Nevertheless, Ireland's leader has spent two days in Europe, which is unprecedented - one with President Barroso and today with Chancellor Merkel.
This all shows an engagement with Europe that we might not have had before.
On this point, the directive has the potential to help us all across Europe to get out of the economic crisis and create prosperity.
Unfortunately, many countries, including my own, have not transposed this directive into law.
Hopefully, that will change with the new government.
Particularly where SMEs are concerned, there is great potential.
It has not been availed of because they are not aware of it, because of difficulties with language, etc.
The first thing is certainly to transpose the directive into law.
Secondly, the EU needs to impose barriers and penalties on countries that do not abide by the deadlines.
It has been far too easy up to now.
If we are to have progress, this has to be done.
If each SME had one more employee, unemployment would cease in Europe.
This is a great opportunity, as Mr Harbour and others have said.
We cannot afford to wait.

European tourism has recently experienced a difficult economic situation, and this was aggravated by the eruption of the volcano in Iceland last year, because the interruption of air traffic due to the presence of volcanic ash clouds had a major effect on travel in Europe, causing significant disruption to airlines, travel agencies and tour operators as well as tourists themselves.
It is therefore very important to improve and define a new policy framework for tourism in Europe.
Furthermore, this sector is facing increasing difficulties and new challenges, such as competition, demographic trends, climate change and environmental constraints, and the seasonal distribution of tourist movements, which need to be addressed at both European Union and Member State levels.
It is important to draw attention to the fact that tourism is a major economic activity with a broadly positive impact on economic growth and employment in Europe.
Consequently, it is necessary to update and optimise the legal framework for European statistics on tourism, and we should strengthen the EU tourism sector through specific proposals and initiatives that would complement Member State programmes.
Tourism is also an increasingly important aspect in the lives of European citizens, more and more of whom are travelling, either for leisure or business.
Furthermore, this sector impinges on cultural and natural heritage and on traditions and contemporary cultures in the European Union.
Consequently, it is important to define a new framework for action to increase its competitiveness and its capacity for sustainable growth.
<d>
I am voting in favour of this resolution because I consider it essential that the EU provide a suitable mechanism for resolving disputes arising from the implementation of Euro-Mediterranean agreements.
In 2006, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with partners in the Mediterranean region and only in 2009 was that agreement signed.
The creation of a standard method for resolving disputes should ultimately introduce simplified and effective resolution procedures within specific time limits.
I agree with the opinion of the rapporteur who considers it essential that revisions of the Euromed free trade agreements be made in order to contribute to economic and political stability in this region and to consolidate an area of peace and development.
The proposed method is modelled on the most up-to-date mechanisms for dispute resolution in partnership agreements as agreed by the European Union and the WTO.
At a time when foreign direct investment has a crucial role in the economic wellbeing of European Member States, I hope that an effective dispute settlement mechanism will help to resolve disputes in this area also.

(EL) Mr President, it took us 25 years to forget Chernobyl and I fear that the disaster in Japan will not suffice to remind us.
We have been systematically condemning Japan.
It is as if we want to say that it is Japan, rather than nuclear energy, that is unsafe.
We have started safety tests on our nuclear power plants and are again insisting that there is such a thing as safe nuclear technology.
We need to shut down nuclear power plants over thirty years old immediately and put an end to any thoughts of building new plants.
We need an immediate 'nuclear' tax that will allow us to reflect the entire environmental cost of nuclear energy.
We need to invest in improving the performance of photovoltaic energy and to make real investments in increasing the performance of all renewable energy sources.
Commissioner, the legislative initiative and responsibility for our action, or the consequences of our failure to act, lie with you.
<d>
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report on the activity of the European Investment Bank (EIB) highlights some important and welcome points.
The first of these is the need to focus our efforts more and more on making it easier for small and medium-sized enterprises to have access to credit.
I also welcome the reference to the project bond initiative, which I believe is a useful tool for growth and development in a sector as strategic as that of infrastructure.
I am somewhat puzzled by the reference to the EIB's external activities, for which more financial and human resources are being requested.
The EIB report for 2009 indicates the countries benefiting from such loans, and I note with disappointment that Turkey receives the lion's share with almost a third of the total granted to all non-EU states.
This figure is also just over a quarter of the amount granted to Italy, one of the main EIB shareholders. Italy itself is also in need of substantial loans and grants.
I therefore consider this to be an absurd imbalance.
I believe it is unacceptable that vast resources should be granted to a country like Turkey, which is outside the EU and, in my view, should always remain so.
<d>
Brussels, which is considered by some to be second only to Washington as a mecca for lobbyists, needs proper regulations and clearly-defined principles of cooperation between decision makers and representatives of various interest groups.
We should remember that lobbying, interpreted as advocacy by various social groups, is an indivisible part of contemporary democratic systems.
Once again, Members have expressed their support for the introduction of transparency.
A common register of lobbyists will increase transparency in EU institutions.
It will also distinguish between representatives of pressure groups and representatives of non-governmental organisations and government organisations.
There is no doubt that interest groups present a platform for the exchange of information and are an important channel of communication between citizens and the European Union.
To make this cooperation as effective as possible so that it achieves the expected results, it should be regulated and transparent.
<d>
(FI) Madam President, as far as common corporate tax is concerned, it would be a very challenging prospect for the European Union, because its 27 Member States are all very different.
Their economic structures are very different, though of course, as we are in the Single Market, it is very important to ensure that small and mediumsized enterprises, which actually make up the backbone of the European economy, have fairly equal opportunities for competition.
At present, that is not the case, and in that sense it is very important that a review of SMEs is now conducted.
Being from Finland, for example, I realise very clearly that Finnish companies are a very long way from the heart of the internal market and, for that reason, logistical costs - transport costs - push up the prices of products considerably.
We therefore need different systems of compensation via taxation even within the European Union, but also in other ways, so that the competition situation might be fairer for everyone.
It is very important that a report such as this one has been produced and that we should also aim to consider companies in remote areas in the north, for them to be able to compete on an equal footing with other European companies.
<d>
I fully supported the adoption of this report which approves Bulgaria and Romania joining the Schengen area.
Both States have worked hard to beef up border controls and have been successful, as confirmed by the positive findings of the evaluations and expert visits organised by the Council's Schengen Evaluation Working Group.
Both countries have met all the technical criteria laid down by the European Union.
Consequently I fully support their full participation in the Schengen area.
Member States cannot add new conditions (such as an assessment of policies on combating corruption and crime) or change the rules at half-time.
This week marks the 26th anniversary of the Schengen Agreement, one of the EU's greatest achievements, which must be defended, as must freedom of movement, which is a fundamental right for European Union citizens.
<d>
author. - (FR) Mr President, the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left took the decision not to associate itself with this resolution on Guantánamo.
We do not deplore its substance; rather, we find it pretty feeble.
For my part, I regret the way in which we worked on drafting this resolution.
How cautious we have been in the way we have talked about condemning the human rights violations perpetrated by a country which claims to be the greatest democracy in the world, which still has the death penalty, and for which Guantánamo is an illustration to the world of human rights and international law violations committed in the name of combating terrorism.
Men have been held in detention for almost ten years on this part of Cuban territory for the sole purpose of bypassing US legal jurisdiction and in spite of the lack of evidence against some of them.
For those men, this is a case of arbitrary detention.
Worse still, some of them have been tortured, including on European soil: in Romania, in Lithuania and in Poland.
This must not be spoken of, however.
We can lecture the entire world on human rights but we are incapable of enforcing them on our own territory.
We must not even speak of it today, in this resolution!
I regret this most sincerely and I do not think that this is how we will promote respect for human rights in the world.
Yes, it is essential to prevent the death sentence being imposed on Mr Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri and on many others, but we could have condemned more strongly the position of the United States in this regard, while regretting, at the very least, the change in attitude on the part of President Obama, particularly with regard to military tribunals.
(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149 (8))

Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I have a short comment in anticipation of our trilogue and in response to two specific questions, from Mr Capoulas Santos and Ms Grelier, defending the food scheme for 'most deprived persons'.
They know what has happened: a Court of Justice ruling requiring that food covered by the scheme should come only from 'stocks' has resulted in a reduction of volume from EUR 500 million to EUR 113 million.
Therefore we need to find a solution, and probably a new legal basis for the scheme.
My second brief comment is in response to Mr Bütikofer, who claims that we have not done enough to reflect energy priorities in the next budget.
It has to be understood that in the current year - as a result of delay on investment projects, especially Nabucco and the other projects with Azerbaijan, and also of Azerbaijan relaxing after winning the Eurovision song contest - we have huge delays.
Unfortunately, this also affects programming for the next period in relation to major energy interconnectors.
To all those who would like to cut the budget, my message is that among our legal obligations to make payments in 2012, we are required to make payments to Greece and to some other countries that are in trouble.
They need austerity but they also need investment, and our legal obligations are about investment - about structural funding for these countries for the next year.
<d>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council has listened to a debate of high moral tone, if I may say so, and also of great political support for action the European Union, the Council, the Commission and all the Member States may take at an objectively difficult time.
Without seeking to reply to individual Members who have spoken, I would like to make two or three comments. One is also about method: I must tell you frankly - and I say this more on my own behalf than on behalf of the Council - that European Union foreign policy measures cannot always be taken at the speed that may be required.
There is a necessary and objective process of joint planning which can be an advantage but may also, as in this case, be a disadvantage of the European Union.
The crisis broke last week, and as Commissioner Van den Broek put it, very well I think, it involves an evaluation of degree, which is difficult and needs to weighed with great wisdom because no-one can deny - and this has been the attitude of all the Member States of the European Union, at Palermo and then in a wider spectrum of nations at Sharm-el-Sheikh - that terrorism must be condemned and countries supporting terrorism or even suspected of it must be given some kind of warning.
In fact the troika went to Teheran on 2 April, that is, after Sharm-el-Sheikh and before the current crisis.
Nevertheless there was terrorist aggression by Hizbollah and the Israelis reacted, and we now have to weigh that not in a pharmacist's scales - where human suffering is involved we cannot pick over who did the most and who is at fault - but politically, to save the peace process as far as possible.
Various comments have been made about Syria and its attitude, about Lebanon which is suffering from the violence of others, but also about Israel's patience and determination to achieve peace as demonstrated over all these months, about the terrorist attacks inside the country, and about the sacrifice of Yitzhak Rabin, and I would say in homage to him that it was an almost classical sacrifice to the peace process.
All this must be considered when intervention is described as too slow - although that is true, there is no denying it.
I would like to say that the presidency, all of us, were already doing everything possible last week to try to find suitable ways of ending this process, through contacts which are not always public - Mr Pettinari will forgive me - because of the delicacy and caution required not to break the threads of the fabric, the sometimes very delicate weave of a peace process which in itself is extremely fragile because it depends not just on governments but also on zealous or fanatical splinter groups.
I would like to make two or three more points.
I think the initiatives of individual countries, appreciable and noble and important though they may be, and that is how they are described in a communication to the President of 15 April, but the efforts of each country to contribute to the extent of its influence, weight and tradition certainly need to be coordinated with the Community's general measures.
In this case France certainly took a very noble initiative and the presidency was in fact informed and it was implemented in a way that made it part of a collective plan, a common design.
This is, I repeat, an extremely delicate issue, and if it is to be handled successfully I do not think everything can be made public. Sometimes matters have to be discussed with extreme caution.
The objective is to involve everyone in a peace process, every zone in the area, every country and every effort they can make towards it.
Today, at this very moment, American Under-Secretary Peltow is in Rome to try to coordinate joint action with the presidency in the hope that this can have some effect.
And here I would like to remind you that on the 29th the follow-up to Sharm-el-Sheikh will be held in Luxembourg in a Community setting.
To demonstrate that the presidency of the Council intends to keep Parliament informed of these important events, I will tell you what has been communicated to me at this time. The troika is also going to Tel Aviv, a stage which was not planned for the first tour, and through the contacts made in the two day tour of Amman, Beirut, Cairo and Tel Aviv, it is seeking to restore vitality to the 1993 understanding between the Hizbollah and Israel, which I mentioned earlier, and put an end to the crisis.
In addition to this, other ideas have been outlined and the American Under-Secretary is examining them today in Rome.
This delegation is not just at the level of policy directors, Mr Lalumière, but involves Under-Secretaries of State, and that is precisely to give the troika's mission not only a functional value but a higher political profile to increase its importance and, as far as possible, send a political signal from the European Union.
At the moment the troika delegation is in Cairo, tomorrow it will be in Damascus, and the day after tomorrow in Tel Aviv.
In addition to this, it is necessary to think about a new form of involvement in this plan of ours and about the forces in Lebanon, Syria, Israel, Egypt, and throughout the area which can restore the peace.
Some things are still in the pipeline so I cannot go into as much detail as I would like.
But I want to assure Parliament and honourable Members that all of us, the Council, the presidency, the Member States, quite clearly regard this as an issue of the greatest importance.
Mr Alavanos is right that it is in fact of special interest to Italy, for obvious reasons it seems to me, but unfortunately Italy is not acting alone and there are many things to be considered.
The point is very simple: we have to do everything possible, but not pass judgement, which is very difficult to do at the moment, faced with the suffering of the Israeli people and, of course, of the people of Lebanon.
It does not help to pass judgement on who is in the wrong and who is in the right at a time like this: what will help is doing everything we can to prevent a very difficult and fragile peace process from breaking down because of irresponsible acts of terrorism and, as one honourable Member said, this Parliament should not talk only of peace when it is still to be achieved.
<d>
Mr President, the conclusions of the G7 meeting held in Lille early in April are clearly aligning the industrialized countries towards an American-style economic policy, which is considered to generate more jobs at the cost of greater flexibility of employment. Unfortunately, however, its objective can also be stated in different terms: a gradual lowering of our social standards to the much lower average required by a globalization we have been unable to control.
In the eyes of the growing number of Europeans, the aim of the policy pursued by Brussels seems to be to break down national peculiarities in order to clear the road for this globalization and facilitate its progress.
Instead of protecting us, therefore, the policy of Brussels would become the implicit ally of those opposed to our societies, our ways of life and our nations.
The answer most frequently given to this serious accusation is that the best way in which the European States can defend themselves is to improve their competitiveness.
Unfortunately, however, that is only partly true.
Does the Commission think that the cost of European labour will be able to compete with the cost of labour in the emerging countries?
Does it think that, by disrupting national societies, it will promote a competitiveness of the European region?
And if not, how does it expect to reestablish a community preference which is capable not of preventing globalization but of disciplining it?
<d>
Mr President, I think it is important to speak and thank Under-Secretary Fassino for what he has said, because at a time when Albania, which is effectively part of Europe, should be receiving our particular attention, we need to look at the negative and the positive aspects before we make choices and judgements.
So it is important for the political dialogue to be geared precisely to understanding what is going on.
I agree with what Mr Oostlander said because in my opinion, in our opinion, it is essential to understand exactly what is going on before making decisions, because it seems to us that some observers mentioned negative factors, others positive.
So we need to begin a careful evaluation, be present on the ground and see if there is some way we can intervene.
So that is what we think is important, before making any choice,...
(The President cut the speaker off)

I cannot support the EU investing a great deal of money in research which is not in line with the Greens' proposals.
The research includes aerospace research, as the text states that air traffic will double within the next 15 years.
Flying is not an environmentally friendly form of transport.
More resources should rather be made available for research in the fast train industry.
It is true that this is also included in the proposal but I would like to increase its share considerably.
There are many areas and objectives that I approve of, however, and I support the amendments, for example the reduction of the appropriation for nuclear safety by ECU 10 million.
Unfortunately, experience shows that this money contributes to the continued use of nuclear energy and gives the impression, in the Eastern European countries as well as elsewhere, that nuclear power is safe.
Nuclear power is not safe and we should instead invest money in renewable sources of energy in order to get away from nuclear power.
I am voting against Amendments Nos 50 and 51 because they do not take money away from Euratom.
I support Amendments Nos 55-57 because they ensure that Euratom money goes into support for renewable sources of energy.
<d>
Mr President, I am surprised that you have allowed the objection in the topical and urgent debate pursuant to Rule 47, i.e. to switch the question of the transporting of atomic waste with the subject of elections in Bosnia.
I am referring to Rule 47, which says that a motion for a resolution tabled in accordance with paragraph 1 cannot be included on the agenda for a debate on topical and urgent subjects etc. etc.... if the subject covered by this motion is already on the agenda for that part-session.
Now there is absolutely no doubt, Mr Hänsch, that the subjects of the former Yugoslavia, Bosnia and elections are already on the agenda, since they feature in several reports that are to be debated this afternoon.
The reports by Mr Alavanos, Mr Mendiluce Pereiro, Mr Giansily, Mr Titley and Mr Pex are of course concerned with this subject.
I am very surprised that you should ever have allowed the motion by the Group of the European People's Party.
In doing so you have created a precedent!
I am therefore requesting that the matter should be discussed again this afternoon, at the Conference of Presidents, because up to now it has always been argued, in practice, that subjects for topical and urgent debate are not allowed if the subject is already being dealt with in other debates.
<d>
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, when it comes to people, freedom of movement in the European Union is a complicated business.
Mr Caccavale was quite right to point out that all kinds of things can be transported within this Union, and all kinds of things can move unhindered across the frontiers - which indeed no longer officially exist.
Only people may not move as freely in the European Union as we would all have wished.
That is why I should like to remind you of something again today, namely that the European internal market began on 1 January 1993, with fireworks and celebrations throughout the European Union.
And what were we celebrating?
Was it the fact that anyone may now take any product, service or capital holding and move freely with it in the Europe of Fifteen?
Yes, that was part of it.
But we were not - at least my group was not - celebrating the fact that some essential preconditions for the implementation of people's right to move freely in the newly created Europe would still not be met almost four years later.
So why has this right not yet been implemented?
It has not been implemented because a number of Member States - or rather their governments - regard with mistrust the fact that their citizens, and permanent residents in their countries who are not citizens, can move freely in the Union.
We have heard all kinds of arguments this morning for curtailing this individual liberty.
But one thing is crystal clear: the overwhelming majority of people who live in our Union - I do not know the exact figures, but we can assume that we are talking about well over 90% of the population - are honest, upright, decent folk who ought to be able to travel freely from one part of the Union to another, whether they are passport holders of one of the Member States, or citizens of a third country with a permanent address in the Union.
Why are the governments mistrustful?
Why do they continue to restrict these people's freedom of movement because of the criminal activities of a few small groups such as heroin and arms dealers and those who traffic in human beings?
Such groups undoubtedly pose real problems, but they cannot justify the continued restriction of freedom of movement.
It is high time that we made progress - by creating a confidence offensive.
After the delays which caused the conflict between Parliament and the Council and Commission, we are now debating these reports because of initiatives taken by the Commissioner, who is with us here today: initiatives which, though commendable, are insufficient.
Now, in the midst of this process, we learn that the body representing the Member States, which are responsible for the delays - namely the Council - has clearly gone behind the backs of Parliament and the Commission once again, by initiating a procedure which seeks to replace everything that we are debating today and in which neither we nor, of course, the Commission will have any part.
There is only one way for us to respond: we shall request postponement of the vote, pursuant to Rule 129, to give us the opportunity of reconsidering this latest development in committee, as provided for under Rule 60, because it is absolutely unacceptable that the right - and in particular Parliament's right - of democratic participation, which is not extensive at the best of times, should be further thwarted by an attempt, at this stage of our deliberations, to make a mockery of the consultation procedure, in the sense that the Council is ignoring everything that we say here in the House and producing a fait accompli behind our backs.
In my view, this is something that we cannot accept.
<d>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is the human embryo a fully-fledged human being?
The Italian bioethics committee has declared that the embryo is one of us.
So there we have it: it is a form of life and deserves protection, rights and respect.
The committee has produced and published a document entitled 'Identity and statute of the human embryo', and for the first time, we in Italy can state decisively that the embryo - or the female egg fertilized by male sperm - is not a thing, but forms part of humankind, and that its personal identity exists from the moment of fertilization, in other words as from conception.
As always, the question arises: when does an embryo start to be one of us, a European citizen in fact, and in what ways can it be used?
Once again, the committee repeats that a human being becomes one at the moment of conception, and allows science to work only with dead embryos.
Although many people think that an embryo is human as from the fourteenth day, the document drawn up by this Italian committee of experts states that the various nuclei of life which precede the formation of the single embryo are themselves already individuals and are therefore untouchable; right from the moment of conception, that is to say.
I think that the Pelttari report merits a good deal of attention: in a very responsible and capable way, it outlines the arguments for life and the need to protect the embryo; for my part, I shall vote in favour of it as it stands.
Nevertheless, we have to catch and run with this ball once and for all, go beyond the bounds of this report, and resolve to draw up a statute and a law designed exclusively to protect the embryo.
Again and again, of course, we are confronted by the problems of industry which, in championing the cause of human health and our right to treatment, urges us to come out in favour of the directive which would make it possible to patent living and non-living beings, including man, by enticing us with arguments about increased employment and raising the spectre of an invasion, in the field of biotechnology, by American and Japanese multinationals.
Yet again, however, the European Parliament is refusing to face the facts, namely that in the UK 9000 embryos - 9000 human beings - are soon to be slaughtered like mad cows, if no one comes to their rescue.
I did ask for an urgent resolution on the subject at this part-session, but my request was completely ignored.
What is certain is that we must come to a final decision, in all consciousness, as responsible citizens.
Certainly, once we decide that embryos are human beings, we shall have to revise our attitude to abortion and - why not - begin to clamp down on all moves towards euthanasia.
<d>
Mr President, I have very little add to what I said in response to the debate earlier this afternoon except to say that Mrs Ahern must have missed by speech.
She clearly did not get the points I made earlier on.
I should like to join with those who have thanked Mrs Banotti for the way she has pursued and raised this issue and to thank Mr Andrews for his kind words of welcome and encouragement.
I have listened to this debate with great interest.
I understand the sentiments and concerns expressed by those interested in this matter.
It is an important and sensitive issue and it is one on which the Council is taking action, as I said earlier in the debate.
I will report what I have heard here today to my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Mrs Nora Owen, who is President-in-Office of the Justice and Home Affairs Council.
I know that she will be reporting in detail to the relevant committee of this House in the coming weeks.
I have no doubt it is one of the issues that will be raised.
I will draw her full attention to this debate.
I hope it is not a sexist remark to say that I was very struck by the number of women Members who contributed to this debate.
As it happens, we have a woman Minister for Justice in Ireland who is President-in-Office of the Justice and Home Affairs Council and would be particularly sensitive to the issues which have been raised here.
It would fall to her to ensure that the response of the presidency and the Irish Government will be made to the relevant European Parliament committee.
I will certainly ensure that this is drawn to her attention.
I do not know if the House knows that Mrs Owen is Mrs Banotti's sister and that is a happy coincidence.
It is very useful on this occasion that the Member who is pursuing this so vigorously has the ear and direct access to the Minister.
I have been very taken with the debate today and I will be sure, on behalf of the presidency, to make sure that what has been said here today is drawn to the Minister's attention.
Mr Andrews raised a broader question which in turn is worthy of examination.
I would encourage him in his endeavours to raise this matter again in the autumn.
Proposals coming forward from Parliament in this regard would be welcomed by the presidency.
It is an issue which for far too long we have either chosen to ignore or for one reason or another have not been aware of.
The debate today has been a very useful and helpful one and it will inform the presidency in our approach to pursuing this issue in the Council of Ministers.
I assure the House that the President-in-Office of the Justice and Home Affairs Council will be made fully aware of the concerns of the House by me and by my department following tonight's debate.
<d>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first and foremost I should like to thank Mr Lange for his careful examination of the 1995 annual report on the Union's research activities.
Mr Lange has conducted an in-depth analysis which has enabled him to make very valuable recommendations.
I should add, though, that I do consider some of the views contained in this report, and expressed in the motion for a resolution under discussion today, to be a little harsh.
To some extent, I feel, this harshness is based on a misunderstanding.
So what I would like to do this evening is briefly to recall the nature and function of the annual report on the Union's research activities, to place that report in its context amid the overall apparatus for providing information on, evaluating and monitoring research activities, and finally to let you know what improvements the Commission intends to make to that apparatus, along the lines of the recommendations contained in your motion for a resolution.
The submission by the Commission of an annual report on the Union's research activities complies with an obligation stated in Article 130p) of the Treaty.
The annual report is not an evaluating report.
Nor is its function to enable research activities to be reoriented or new priorities defined.
Its purpose, first and foremost, is to provide information.
A rigorous evaluation of the research programmes and their results is, of course, essential.
But that is provided by means of instruments other than the annual report.
That is the second point upon which I would like to touch.
The Commission's communication of 22 May 1996 on the evaluation and monitoring of the programmes makes a very clear distinction between two functions.
The monitoring function is provided through the annual monitoring reports on the specific programmes and the framework programme.
Those reports are essentially factual in nature.
Next, the function of evaluation: the objective here is to assess the degree to which the programmes have achieved the objectives set for them, and how suitable they are for the intended purposes.
Another objective is to identify those areas where the Union's activities should be redirected.
With this in mind, five-yearly reports evaluating these specific programmes and the framework for them are prepared by panels of independent experts.
The first monitoring reports have been sent to the European Parliament.
The first five-year evaluation reports are in preparation, and will be available at the end of the year, at the time of the debate on the fifth framework programme.
As far as the framework programme is concerned, Mr Étienne Davignon is chairing the group responsible for preparing this report.
The annual report, which like the monitoring reports is essentially factual in nature, will take its place alongside this dual apparatus.
Finally, as agreed, a few words on our intentions for the future.
The 1995 annual report certainly leaves room for improvement.
There are three facts I should mention by way of explanation for this running-in period.
First, this report was the first of its kind. Its preparation coincided with the installation of the new evaluation monitoring arrangements.
It also coincided with the launch of the fourth framework programme, the initial information on which was not available until quite late in the year.
But I would like to be very clear about this: the Commission intends to use all the appropriate diligence in carrying out the evaluation and monitoring work.
The communication being prepared for tomorrow, which provides guidelines on the fifth framework programme, explicitly refers to the need to develop an instrument of the indicator type which enables the progress and performance of the programmes to be measured. Improvements are going to be made to the entire apparatus of information, evaluation and monitoring, which has to be regarded as a whole.
Those improvements will be specifically along the lines recommended in your motion for a resolution. A harmonized system for recording information on the implementation status of the programmes will be set up.
Those factors which are related to the aspects causing more concern, especially the implementation periods and the break-down of financing by participant or by region, will be more clearly illustrated.
Elements of a qualitative assessment of the implementation of the programmes and the results obtained will be provided.
Efforts will be made to expedite the production of the annual report, within the time limits necessary for the availability of the mathematical data.
In conclusion, I believe that the annual report, the monitoring reports and the evaluation reports constitute a highly complex array of instruments at the disposal of the Members of Parliament, and indeed of the authorities in the Member States.
This should enable them to gain a full and accurate idea of the Union's research activities, and to assess the extent to which their stated objectives are being achieved.

Mr President, other speakers have already pointed out what a pathetic figure the Council has cut in the present budgetary procedure.
In contrast to its ringing declarations of support for employment policy, the budgetary procedure has seen quite the opposite approach being adopted.
Let us think of the cuts in social policy, internal policies, energy policy, and the rest.
The list also includes structural policy, although we should not engage in shadow-boxing on that issue.
Ultimately, it will make no difference at all if we include a billion more or less: the real scandal is that ECU 23 billion has so far gone unspent - at a time when there are 18 million people out of work in the Union.
The fact that this discrepancy between appearances and reality occurs behind closed doors should not lead us to think that the people of Europe fail to recognize it.
Perhaps, indeed, the latest election results go to show that only opposition parties can now be successful at the polls.
Despite the attitude of the Council, the Socialist Group has tried to support the employment policy.
We regret that those on the right of the House have been unable to give that policy their full backing.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have been living with summertime for quite a while now, and we are not really consciously aware of its adverse effects.
The tiresome changeover twice a year is, I believe, a negligible problem.
When summertime was introduced in Austria, it came in for some very heated criticism.
For example, there were people who predicted that there might be or would be problems for farmers, because nature is no respecter of clocks and farmers would not really derive any benefit from summertime.
No doubt it would be easier to leave the time unchanged throughout the year.
Even so, we should be conscious of the advantages of summertime, and especially the advantages of a standardized arrangement.
I am committed to the single market, and without a uniform arrangement there can be no question of a functional single market, which is the necessary basis for greater cohesion in Europe.
Consequently, the set dates for the start and the end of summertime are to be welcomed.
In addition, we currently have three time zones within the Community.
It is important to ensure that the time difference between countries is never more than one hour, which actually is already too much.
First and foremost, our concern must be to protect consumers.
It is in the interest of consumers - travellers, for example - to have arrangements that are as standardized and simple as possible, another argument in favour of an EU-wide arrangement.
In the countries of central and southern Europe, summertime offers advantages for the consumer, and for industry too.
Longer days open up additional opportunities in leisure planning and so have a beneficial effect on the leisure industry.
Longer days are also important to the tourist industry in central and southern Europe: many museums and tourist leisure facilities benefit from the extra daylight, and this in turn benefits the tourists themselves.
Then there are also those matters of transport safety that have already been mentioned.
The fact remains, in any case, that summertime is very popular with a large proportion of Europe's population.
Let us simply make the framework as simple as possible and so agree to the Commission's proposal.
<d>
The next item is the election of the Quaestors of the European Parliament.
The following nominations have been received:
Mr Balfe Mr Bardong Mr Killilea Mr Paasio Mr Ribeiro Mr Viola
The candidates have told me that they have agreed to stand.
Since the number of candidates exceeds the number of posts to be filled, there will be a secret ballot.
I remind Members that according to Rule 16 of the Rules of Procedure the number of Quaestors shall be five.
The members of the European Parliament have a maximum of five votes.
Any ballot papers containing more than five votes will be declared null.
The election officers will be the same as for the previous elections, and I ask them to stand by the ballot boxes.
(The vote took place)

Madam President, in view of the comments which have just been quoted, one can only hope that the Prime Minister's political career will one day be buried underneath this rubbish.
You have asked here today, Mr Santer, where we would be if common sense had prevailed in the past.
Certainly, we would be living in a more democratic, more social and more ecological Europe, instead of in an uncontrolled market and under the rule of technocrats.
However, it is not the task of the European Parliament to bid a sad farewell to common sense, but to demand it and to exact retribution when it is ignored.
Did it really take you 16 deaths and 23 suicides among ruined farmers in the UK, Mr Santer?
Did it really take you the necessary, but nonetheless barbaric destruction of more than a million cattle?
Did it really take you the amount of ECU 10 billion in compensation to realize that there was a lack of common sense in the EU's policy, to discover the need to control economic interests through that policy and to safeguard human dignity?
But common sense has not simply ceased to prevail in Europe - people in positions of responsibility have stopped behaving sensibly.
The Commission too has given economic interests and political considerations priority over common sense.
Who forced the Commission, Mr Santer, against all common sense - and here I quote from the report - to play down the problem of BSE from the outset; to give the beef market priority over human health; to pursue a policy of disinformation which ultimately interfered with the Community's ability to legislate; to ignore the warning voices of scientists; to have blind faith in industry lobbyists?
Who forced the Commission into inefficiency, political weakness, and a policy of concealment and obstruction towards Parliament?
Perhaps it is the fact that, in its heart of hearts, the Commission also believes in and has committed itself to an aggressive neo-liberal ideology.
Is it not true to say that this dominance of economic interests over common sense and human dignity extends across the whole agricultural sector?
Do we not see the same attitude in the brutal imposition of the convergence criteria for entry into monetary union, with its acceptance of escalating unemployment figures, growing poverty and social crises?
Do we not see the same attitude in the Commission's decision to authorize genetically engineered maize, with the same disregard for warning voices and the same subservience to industry?
Do we not see the same attitude in the role played by the Commission at the Intergovernmental Conference, where it has not put forward dynamic proposals on the comprehensive democratization of the EU, the development of a social area in Europe and an ecological alliance?
Make no mistake about it, Mr Santer. If the Greens are proposing a qualified motion of censure today, it is not because the Commission does not deserve to be censured, but because there was no prospect of us securing the necessary majority, because the failure of such a motion would have been portrayed by you as an acquittal, and because through a qualified motion of censure, we see a slight chance of opening the door for the return of common sense, after its period of exile from the European Union.
<d>
Madam President, I agree with the statement made a few minutes ago by Kenneth D. Collins, but I would like to clarify a little more clearly the second part of the dossier.
First of all, as regards the first part, it should be noted that we are faced with a serious problem.
Two hundred and forty-six substances used as veterinary medicines before the adoption of the 1990 regulation have not yet been re-evaluated!
There is no maximum limit established for residues and, de facto, the use of these substances has been prohibited since the 1st January.
It is therefore imperative to extend the deadlines for this evaluation, as proposed by the Commission.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection notes its agreement with the above, under one condition: for the most dangerous substances, or at all events those that might be suspected to be the most dangerous, this evaluation must be made before the 1st January 1998.
I would now like to talk about the second part of the proposal, which is much more serious.
In fact, the Commission is proposing to amend the 1990 regulation by granting the pharmaceutical industry the possibility of using, with provisional limit values, drugs which are still at the clinical trial stage.
This means in particular that consumers would become involuntary guinea pigs for the pharmaceutical industry.
These provisional limits are in fact proposed by the pharmaceutical industry and are currently studied by the drug agency and the appropriate committees.
This is an amendment in relation to 1990, as at the time this measure was considered to be exceptional.
At the present time, it is becoming general.
I know that everyone within the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection agrees that this is unacceptable.
We are asking the Commissioner to express himself clearly on this point.
Does he agree to withdraw this part of the proposal, yes or no?
I believe that that is what is at stake, and not the first part on which we agree.
I would nevertheless like to return to Mr Santer's statements.
He said yesterday that with regard to the health and phytosanitary measures, he would like to use Article 100 A. One can admit that, for the first part, the situation is urgent, but this is not the case for the second part.
(Interruption by the Commissioner) All the better, Mr Bangemann, confirm it clearly!
In your statement just now - perhaps it is a problem with the translation - you talked about the main issue.
I would like to talk about the second part of your proposal, which dealt with the temporary limit system for drugs which are still at the clinical trial stage.
Be clear on the matter and say that you withdraw this proposal!
<d>
Again I insist that the Court of Justice still has not taken a decision.
However, there is already a series of Court of Justice decisions according to which, when there is a violation of Community legislation by a Member State, it is possible to ask a national court to make that Member State pay appropriate compensation.
In accordance with French law, the French state is responsible for any damage caused to persons or goods as a result of the use of force or violence during demonstrations or similar protests.
As a consequence, this type of request could be made by the British lorry drivers.
I do not think that it is an act of discrimination that claims in France should be submitted in French; this is a matter of French national law and it seems to me totally logical that compensation claims...
(Interruption for technical reasons)
<d>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to remind you that this debate is a première.
The Commission was not bound, by the provisions of Article 40 of the Euratom Treaty, to consult the European Parliament.
It has, however, done so.
Apart from your natural elegance and the good manners that you have shown to the European Parliament I should like to tell you, Commissioner, that you were right to do this.
We all need the support of public opinion when it comes to energy problems.
It is quite remarkable to see that in Europe, over the last 40 years, nuclear policies have been worked out by small groups of men - scientists, politicians and industrialists - without any real public consultation before decisions were taken, in particular through the intermediary of their national representatives.
It is, therefore, a good thing that an institution like ours should have its word to say about energy policy, both in terms of Member States and at the level of the European Union as a whole.
The second comment I would like to make is that the geopolitical conditions have changed since the signing of the Euratom Treaty as well as the prosperity of 30 years which passed between 1950 and 1980.
The question of the European Union's energy independence has become a crucial one.
The world, contrary to what was thought in 1989, is still somewhat unsafe, and it is from rather unstable areas that most of the Member States' petrol and gas resources come.
Do we really think - and do the public really think - about the situation we would be in if Russia, the Middle East, North Africa, were for a time inaccessible to us?
The Gulf War showed that the West was very quick to intervene because the threat was not a theoretical one.
That is the yardstick by which we must measure the interest of a nuclear industrial policy.
In my report I have asked questions about its efficiency and the risks, and I think that my report is both moderate and pragmatic.
It is moderate because we have to be modest.
What do we know of technological inventions to come in the next few years?
How can we can really make any judgment about a given type of nuclear reactor without far-ranging scientific knowledge?
Of course we must trust the experts, but we must also debate together the conclusions of their work and its findings.
On this subject, I should like to say that I oppose most of the amendments tabled by Mrs McNally for two reasons.
First of all Mrs McNally contradicted her own amendment when she recognised that the Member States have the sovereign right to opt for or against nuclear power and that their choice had to be respected.
In the amendments tabled for the plenary session, Mrs McNally wishes to extend to all Member States a ban on nuclear power in the long run.
This is not in keeping with the initial thought.
But, above all, I should like to tell her that it is not possible not to bear in mind scientific progress.
We are all bound by technical progress and technological advances, and from that point of view we have to trust in progress.
I should like to mention the following points.
Europe is more than 60% dependent for its supplies.
If today or in the coming years nuclear energy was banned or suppressed we would be dependent at a rate of over 80% and, therefore, I would say we would be in greater danger.
Secondly, of course, we are all in favour of renewable energies!
Are they sufficiently advanced at present to enable us to replace what we extract from nuclear sources?
There is no doubt that at the moment the answer to that question is' no '.
Third remark: this industry, at the present time, directly or indirectly employs some 400, 000 people in Europe.
And we want to get rid of those jobs with one amendment!
Finally, industrial nature hates vacuums!
By that I mean to say - although I would not put money on it - that if we put an end to European nuclear industries, the United States and Japan which, unlike you, Commissioner, would not ask us any questions, would be there to replace us, whether in Europe or another continent.
And then, to finish, before a very brief conclusion, we have also in this area a duty of solidarity, interested duty, without any cynicism, towards the countries of Eastern Europe: in particular Ukraine and Russia.
Their nuclear power stations deserve safety levels which are equivalent to ours.
If we just get up and go, we would also be replaced in that domain, and it is our very own safety which is at stake and I think that, therefore, we should maintain a level of technology which is high enough for us to be able to take action in that area.
I have not issued an unreserved approval of the nuclear policy.
But I have placed the necessary emphasis on the need to win over public opinion, and the fact that we must fight against the ageing of nuclear power stations.
It is almost a biological phenomenon of society and one that we must face up to.
We cannot leave nuclear power stations as they are, but we must also trust technical procedures which are currently available to us and which probably will continue making progress to eliminate waste.
But we should not, as Mrs McNally has asked in her amendments, put an end to research funding.
Everyone talks about great ambitions for Europe!
But what would Europe be without energy?
What would agriculture be without energy?
What would be the use of an internal market if we had no energy and if industry slowed down?
What would be the use of a single currency if we had less to buy?
Totally banning the nuclear market at this time is a fantasy for the rich and a theoretical pipe dream about man's future!
<d>
Mr President, Commissioner, I believe there is serious cause for concern in the increase in the number of war zones in Sudan.
Today, fighting is no longer confined to the south of the country but has also spread to the north and - the most dangerous and alarming aspect - to the border zones with Ethiopia and Uganda.
We are witnessing a radical escalation of the Sudanese conflict, which threatens to engulf the entire Horn of Africa.
I therefore regard it as a matter of urgency for the European Union to intervene politically, because we cannot simply stand by to witness the likely explosion of Africa's largest country.
In my view, the Council must put pressure on the government in Khartoum to open an immediate dialogue with the combined opposition represented by the National Democratic Alliance, to accept the IGAD peace plan and to comply with international law by applying the United Nations Security Council's Resolution 1070.
The Sudanese Government must not be allowed to think that it can continue defying the entire international community, and for that reason I believe it should agree to a visit by a UN delegation with a view to clarifying the human rights situation in the country and verifying the activities of the international terrorist training camps of which we have heard so much, and which the Council and the Commission, too, would do well to investigate more closely.
The Council and the Commission should also demand that the Sudanese Government allows access to international humanitarian organizations, so that aid may really reach the civilian population. I am thinking especially of the relaunching of the programmes that have been discontinued, at the initiative of the United Nations, so that they can reach those groups among the population who are most in need of assistance, having for years been the victims of planned extermination by the Sudanese Government.
<d>
Mr President, the annual report by the Committee on Petitions naturally contains little that is controversial.
There is no doubt that there must be mechanisms at every level of government to protect people against abuses of power or the indifference of officialdom.
For example, support and help needs to be given to frontier workers within the European Union facing problems with their tax or pension administrations.
However, it is most regrettable that when this ideal is put into practice using all our highly detailed Community law, it is invariably presented as a kind of victory for democracy.
I would point out that in many cases Community law is introduced in a way that could not remotely be described as democratic, either because decisions are taken behind closed doors where no one monitors what happens, or because they are taken at a level so far removed from the man in the street that there can be no question of controls, let alone involvement.
Let me give you an example.
The Maastricht Treaty provides that in all the Member States, even people who do not have the nationality of the country concerned must have the right to vote in European and local council elections.
This was a totally arbitrary idea, the brainchild of a purely pro-European ideology.
It was a decision taken over people's heads and was not even welcomed by the people concerned, as we can see from the fact that the most recent European elections were a major flop amongst the electorate in question.
For the last three years, I have been asking the Commission at regular intervals for the turn-out figures, and they have always claimed that they are unable to provide them, even now, three years after the event.
In my own country, this European decision is threatening to result in cultural genocide - there is no other word for it - for Flemings around Brussels and in Brussels itself.
Tens of thousands of new voters, almost by definition not Dutch-speaking, of course, are threatening to create a tidal wave of support for the French-speaking parties.
These French-speaking parties represent people who think that they belong to a sort of 'Herrenvolk' that does not need to adapt itself to the language of the country in which it settles, but thinks instead that the native population, the Flemings, the Dutch speakers, should adapt themselves to the newcomers.
This modern form of cynical and brutal colonialism is now being supported by a European decision which the vast majority of my people did not want and which has to be seen as helping to promote cultural genocide.
The Flemish Parliament has actually adopted a motion linking the right to vote in European elections to a number of very strict conditions and restrictions, but it looks very much as if the decision taken by Europe over everyone's heads carries more weight than the democratic wishes of the Flemish Parliament.
It is examples like this which make me think that Europe is often actually harmful to the interests, survival and identity of the nations of the Union. That is why I have become a eurosceptic and why I cannot endorse this report, uncontroversial though it may be.
<d>
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we all know that there is much that can be learnt from history, so here is today's history lesson.
Prince Grigor Potemkin, the favourite of Catherine the Great, had conquered the Crimea.
When the Empress visited her new territory, Potemkin deceived her regarding its actual state with hastily built villages, false fronts and military charades.
That was in 1787.
Today, 210 years later, Prince Potemkin and the Russian Empire are long gone, but Potemkin-style villages are still being built.
The biggest ever is to be inaugurated next week in Amsterdam with the Maastricht II Treaty!
The false front is attractive and welcoming - freedom, security, the rule of law, the Union and the citizens. Mr van Mierlo paints all this in the most glowing colours, and I really do wonder whether he actually believes what he is saying!
Because what is hidden behind the false front?
A masterpiece of empty paragraphs, as in the case of the non-discrimination article, escape routes as in the case of transparency, lip service as in the case of the so-called employment chapter, a verbose vacuum.
Maastricht II needs to make the necessary corrections to make the European Union viable for a pan-European future, for democracy and social ecology.
What we have now is not just inadequate but actually at variance with all the hopes, requirements and justified expectations we have expressed!
Maastricht II completes the first step towards the abolition of democracy in favour of the extension of executive power.
There is no other way to describe the pseudo-communitization of parts of the third pillar, the incipient erosion of basic rights and rule-of-law principles such as the individual right to asylum or data protection!
Instead of finally establishing the Union on a foundation of civil law, where security means legal certainty and not law and order!
The preamble talks about sustainability, but then the rest of the text becomes bogged down in the allpervading logic of growth which, as we know, is the very opposite of a responsible blend of ecology and economy.
A start is made on the militarization of the EU, instead of promoting the demilitarization of foreign policy.
Our task must be to push aside this false front.
We are very much given to talking about transparency and credibility.
But in that case we must not let ourselves be exploited, we must not describe something as success and progress when it is nothing of the kind!
We are not the star witnesses of the latter-day Prince Potemkin, whether his name be Helmut Kohl or Jacques or Hans van Mierlo or whatever.
Our job is to make it clear to the national governments that democracy is an essential for European integration, not an inconvenient obstacle!
We need to make it clear that there are new expectations of a change of direction in economic, social, environmental and ecological policy.
The citizens, Mr van Mierlo, want more than just bread and circuses - they want to know what's cooking, and who is cooking it, and how, and what with.
They want to help the cook.
That is called participation, and it's called democracy, in Europe too!
<d>
Mr President, the ad hoc procedure for compulsory expenditure in the budget is gaining in importance both in Parliament and in the Council.
The rapporteur, Mr Tillich, and the draftsman of the Committee on Agriculture's opinion, Mr Mulder, have worked hard to try to achieve a balanced approach to the budget, taking account of a general political wish for budgetary restraint and at the same time consolidating what had already been decided in terms of policy.
Agricultural expenditure is to increase by no more than 0.45%, although under the Interinstitutional Agreement, the figure should have been 2.1%.
Severe cuts are therefore going to have to be made under certain headings so that others can be increased, such as export refunds for beef.
Three possible instruments are being discussed.
A linear reduction for all headings was rightly rejected by the Committee on Agriculture and Mr Tillich, who instead prefer a reduction based on the possible level of underspending, calculated on the basis of the last three budget years.
The Tillich report also proposes a new kind of reserve containing more than ECU 300 million, so that surpluses under certain agricultural headings are kept available for other headings which have been cut.
It would be good if this approach were to secure general approval, since this would oblige the Council to be a little more flexible and creative.
Finally, there was the possibility of deferring one typical budget item: the oil seed advance totalling ECU 1.4 billion.
These advances are paid around October, and there is nothing unusual about financing them under the current year's budget or the next.
It is an option which we have already been able to put to good use on a number of occasions, but the Council and, apparently, the Committee on Budgets both classify this as' creative accounting '.
This is unfair.
To deny ourselves this possibility would be budgetary masochism.
Let us not tie our own hands here in Parliament, but keep enough options open to be able to settle the difficult problem of compulsory expenditure within a well-ordered and disciplined budget.

As its author is absent, Question No 47 lapses.
Question No 48 by Mr Barros Moura has been withdrawn.
Question No 49 by Ian White (H-0494 / 97):
Subject: Restrictions on regional development funds
Written Question E-1395 / 97 was tabled on 7 April asking whether any specific restrictions were put on European Union Funds being spent on civilian facilities rather than military ones, in terms of the development of airport facilities at Benbecula in the Western Isles of Scotland.
The Commission replied that it had asked the Member State concerned for information regarding the facts.
Has such information been received?
<d>
I voted for the Rothley report because I think that biotechnology is a science of the future with enormous potential for medicine, food and the environment and Europe must give this science a legal framework in terms of invention patents.
The issue of patents currently operates nationally. Especially in the USA, where biotechnology is developing at break-neck speed.
Give this fact, the Rothley report is a pioneering initiative, making amendments to the directive that cover most of the moral and legal concerns of ordinary people.
We should not underestimate the problems of biotechnology for the future of mankind.
We should not underestimate the fears and emotions of those committed to defending our societies and our values against profit at any price and science without conscience.
We therefore had to strike a balance between rules to protect the economic exploitation of biotechnological inventions and ethical concerns that have rightly arisen.
This balance has been struck by this committee report, even if there could have been more precision over certain points.
But that could be the subject of the follow-up given by the European Parliament and the Commission.
<d>
Mr President, the Commission wishes to review the social dialogue.
Good!
This is necessary for several reasons, including the fact that we have a rapidly changing labour market, the boundaries between employee and employer are being erased and more and more people are becoming self employed.
Many, particularly the young, do not share the same sense of participation in labour market organisations which are often collectivist and hierarchical.
In order to resolve the problem of unemployment the labour market must be reformed.
A structure is required which accepts the forces of change and which allows for individual and local solutions.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in continuing our discussion of the review of the social dialogue our initial values must be effectiveness, restraint, transparency and openness and also representativeness and legitimacy.
It is important that the labour market partners do not gain a unique position in the EU's democratic decision making process.
Furthermore, it is extremely important that elected politicians, including those at national level, do not shirk from this difficult task of recreating the right conditions for a healthy labour market.
<d>
Mr President, on behalf of my group I would first of all like to congratulate Mrs Read. As usual, she has done an excellent job.
She has been extremely sensitive to the different points of view expressed and, true to her nature, she has defended the interests of the consumers and users with pugnacity.
On the main points, we are in agreement.
There are two points on which we have minor differences and I would like to elaborate on these.
The first of these points concerns entries in telephone directories.
In many countries this is organized in quite a different way from the way it is done in England or elsewhere.
In some countries it is a business operation, notably for business directories - what is known as yellow pages - and where, of course, those who want an entry and who want to use the directory as a form of publicity must pay for this.
The way Mrs Read has drawn up some of the amendments rules out this possibility which creates difficulties and an removes a significant income.
I know there is no ideal solution, since different countries organize this differently.
In ours, it is more commercially organized and consequently the best thing to do is to invoke the principle of subsidiarity and leave each country to sort out the problem as it sees best.
In any case, we believe that there are certain essential rights: the right to have an entry, the right not to have an entry and the right to correction of any publication which is contrary to the truth or the interests of the person concerned.
The problem is knowing what conditions this occurs under and it is here that some small difficulties appear.
As regards the date problem, you are aware that 1 January is a symbolic date.
On 1 January 1998, the telecommunications market will be deregulated.
For three or four years we have talked, acted, made proposals and legislated with that date in mind.
Consequently, what we need to know today, only a few months from that deadline, is whether we should be realistic and change the date in the legislation on the grounds that certain States are not in a position to honour the deadline.
We personally feel that the date of 1 January 1998 should be retained, but we equally understand that there are worries about being able to achieve all this in three months.
I would like the Commissioner to clarify the position of the Commission on this point.
His response will be the determining factor in how we vote on Mrs Read's Amendments Nos 27 and 28.
Mr President, this is all I wanted to say. I would like to thank once again both the Commission and the rapporteur for the excellent work which they have done to date.
<d>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the question raised by Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, over and above the strict problem of whether the amendment is in order, is nevertheless a question which should be posed.
When this house voted on its timetable for 1997, it violated legality, violated treaties, violated the Edinburgh compromise and violated its Rules of Procedure.
(Mixed reactions) This legal violation was condemned by the highest judicial body in the European Union, the European Court of Justice, on which the duty of stating the law is conferred under treaty.
Now 1997, as far as I know, is not over.
It is therefore consequently perfectly possible even now to comply with this decision.
And the question which is raised is how we are, between now and the end of 1997...
<d>
Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, food additives have a particularly important role, not only because they are significant to quality and price, but because they are important to the consumer.
Austria, Finland and Sweden have a tradition here and I think that this question is of particular importance to those countries.
I believe the identification guideline is sufficient and that it is unnecessary, where E407 and E 407a with the eucheuma alga are concerned, to amend existing law. These products are not going to be sold to consumers, but only to the processing industry, which has learnt how to handle them and where it is clearly seen as sensible for them to be used in the future.
Even the Philippines, which are to a large extent involved with the supply, can draw attention to the fact that these products are permitted in Australia, New Zealand, Japan and the USA, and recognized as very useful.
After all, 240, 000 jobs depend on this product in the Philippines.
I believe we should give serious consideration to the fact that this is also a matter of the future in these countries.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I used to be the rapporteur for the Green Paper on support for the audio-visual production industry in Europe and that was a long time ago.
We set to work on three major instruments which were to provide this support, the Television Directive which has since been abandoned, the Media II programme which is going well and the European guarantee fund with which we are unable to make any progress as it has been blocked by the Council.
But this would be an essential requirement for achieving competitiveness and marketability to take on foreign competition.
We can no longer accept the promotion of small but beautifully formed arts productions, most of which are never seen in any cinema or broadcast on any television channel.
In Germany only every second cinema film reaches a cinema in any case.
They do not even make it to small arts cinemas.
This is the disadvantage of flawed promotion and it is therefore extremely regrettable that as far as I am aware it is actually Germany that is doing the blocking in the Council.
I very much hope that we can make use of the technical knowledge of film-makers, producers, bankers, media institutes and last but not least the film foundations and reach a different decision than previously.
Only in this way will it be possible to exploit the opportunities which have been described here and promote great cinema, mainly in the form of coproductions, of course, which is now the norm in any case.
We shall only have film in coproduction with television, if it is to be competitive.
It is a major growth market.
In the USA it is usual to provide venture capital, but unfortunately not in Europe.
We wanted to use this guarantee fund to make up for this deficiency and if we want fine words to become reality it will depend on this guarantee fund also becoming reality.
I hope the Commission will be able to exert sufficient pressure to achieve this goal.
<d>
Madam President, I certainly will be here for the rest of the debate tonight and will also listen very carefully to the other speakers.
There are very few subjects where so many speakers are involved in the debate.
We appreciate that very much, so maybe I can give an interim reaction.
My feeling as I listen carefully to the various interventions is that there is more that unites us than divides us.
The prime approach which we have in common is that we all feel very motivated, both Parliament and Commission, to make absolutely clear to the candidate countries that they are all part and parcel of the same process and that nobody is left out.
The difference between us may be how we want to make that clear.
To be very frank, when I look at the various amendments such as Nos 12 and 101, I am afraid there is a risk of a certain ambiguity towards those countries which we recommend to continue their preparations as if they were fully entitled to start the negotiations while recognizing that they are actually not sufficiently prepared.
I agree with Mr Hänsch that we could get into a situation, by starting negotiations with those who are not sufficiently prepared, that halfway, when things are not moving fast enough, the pressure is going to mount, for purely political reasons, to accelerate that negotiation process and maybe eventually settle for less fulfilment of the acquis or other conditions from Copenhagen than we normally would have imposed upon new members of the European Union.
I think that is also a factor which we have to take into account.
Finally on this point, when I read those amendments, what strikes me very much is that there is mention on the one hand of the accession process and on the other hand negotiations.
In our approach and concept, negotiations are part and parcel of the accession process.
The accession process contains both, negotiations and preparations.
When you make a recommendation to the Council for an official launch of the enlargement process which implies negotiations for those who are fit for it and preparations for the others, with the whole of the pre-accession strategy attached to it including the partnerships, in which the Council also is going to be involved because it wants to co-decide with us on the priorities to be set, then the signal in the direction of all candidates would be one of being part and parcel, all without exception, of an all-inclusive process.
Whereas now I fear that we are going to have a debate between the Member States in Luxembourg and ambiguity will come out of it as a result.
I obviously respect that the Parliament says that we have to look at this process and at the solutions that we are proposing in a political way.
Of course, and although we have been analyzing a lot of technical data and statistics for a year and a half, I hope that Parliament understands that the Commission is not there only to look at the figures but has a political notion of its own.
It has been in regular contact with each and all of these countries and knows full well what it means to give the wrong political signals.
That is exactly why the all-inclusiveness of the process, with all the elements and instruments that we have put into place: finance, procedures, annual reports, partnerships and everything has been worked out so scrupulously in the very first place for that political reason.
I think that the Commission may ask the Parliament for a minimum of recognition for its work of that kind.
We should not be accused of not knowing about the past of these countries, that they were behind an Iron Curtain and we must indeed watch out that no fear of discrimination is provoked.
Again, if we have a difference of opinion there then I hope it is more a difference in wording than substance and certainly not a difference in political approach.

Madam President, today we are discussing a document from the European Commission on the implementation in 1995 of its actions to promote human rights and democratisation.
The rapporteur, Mr Imbeni, has already laid his finger on the problem in his introduction, and I quote: 'the communication... has the character of a catalogue of good works... (but) does not present itself as an assessment of the effectiveness of human rightsrelated activities'.
It is curious that very large sums, fortunes in fact, have been invested in all kinds of projects, but that apparently there were no interim criteria to verify the usefulness of these investments, or in any case afterwards, and that no investigations were made either into whether the subsidized projects and organizations were also supported by third parties, for example the Member States, independently.
As far as that is concerned I can only agree wholeheartedly with paragraphs 16 and 17 of the report.
I have to admit, however, that my criticism is more fundamental, and that we will have to ask ourselves whether it should be the responsibility of European common institutions in the first place to play a kind of UN, a kind of reduced United Nations, with a truly opaque subsidizing policy, and especially, and this my basic remark, without being this encapsulated in a coherent foreign policy.
Please do not misunderstand me.
I am not saying that all the money in this budget area has been spent fruitlessly.
But I do question in a major way the lack of monitoring when subsidies are given, the lack of evaluation afterwards, the fundamental desirability of leaving the implementation of this policy, which should form part of a coherent foreign policy when it is deemed necessary, in the hands of the European Commission.
Besides, I am not able to check the expenditure of these funds on my own.
But I do know the way in which Commission officials in my own country use all kinds of subsidies to all kinds of organizations.
I can only ascertain that organizations are subsidised which either only represent themselves, or are not worthy of receiving anything, or already get their fair share from various other subsidy sources.
I am thinking of a number of trade unions, for instance.
It might be the case, and I hope so, that the Commission manages the budgets we are talking about today more usefully.
But if this is the case, then I cannot deduce this from the document the Commission is submitting.
I in any case will continue to go on about the fact that in our own Member States millions of people live in abject poverty, so that it is not acceptable in my view to spend large amounts if and when the usefulness of this expenditure of these sums is not even investigated and above all evaluated.
<d>
Mr President, this proposal is obviously linked to the measures to support the process of liberalization in the air transport sector with the aim of ensuring high safety standards.
I congratulate the rapporteur for his excellent work, and the Commission for its excellent proposal.
My concern with the directive proposed is, will it actually improve safety in air transport?
Our aim should surely be to set the best safety practices across Europe.
Currently, the joint aviation authorities seek to achieve cabin crew safety by placing responsibility for safety throughout an airline clearly on the operator.
Currently that operator must ensure comprehensive safety throughout the company and that cabin crew are trained to fit in with that company's specific system.
The directive waters down this responsibility and, therefore, may just possibly undermine cabin crew safety.
The Commissioner, this evening, referred to a number of proposals, including that to set up the European Civil Aviation Safety Agency and efforts to improve the implementation of ICAO standards throughout the European Union.
I would make a plea to the Commission this evening to reach an early agreement with the Council on the setting-up of this European Civil Aviation Safety Agency to ensure that safety both in Europe and worldwide is secured.
The figures show - and were discussed in a conference in Maastricht today - that over the last ten years 70% of all accidents have involved carriers accounting for only 16% of total air traffic.
Those airlines from developing countries appear to be mostly at risk.
Without this European action which is so urgently required, experts predict that quite possibly there could be one air accident a week.
So please, Commissioner, and the British Presidency of the Transport Council, act now.
We must set up this European air transport safety organization with proper safety checks at all European airports to ensure the safety of those European passengers using those carriers and those European residents near Community airports receiving them.
I am delighted to support this report. But I hope that the Commissioner can satisfy me that urgent action will be taken by the Council of Ministers and through his good offices.
<d>
Mr President, I briefly want to congratulate the rapporteurs, Mr Rocard and Mr Vecchi.
Development cooperation is undoubtedly the focus of a number of important issues at the moment.
I do not have a lot of time, but I would like to make a few points.
Mr Vecchi has pointed out the importance of decentralized cooperation because it means moving the focus from individual projects to those involved in the projects.
But this transition, which is very important, also needs to be demonstrated from another point of view.
The EU has the task of making countries who want to cooperate with us aware of their own resources.
Often we do not talk enough about the environmental and cultural wealth of these countries, which could be important resources for them, because, if they are aware of them, they can then understand how to use them to improve their economy in terms of tourism, and we too can offer them important support.
Culture, cultural and environmental wealth with the knowledge and awareness of what they have to give us.
What is important and fundamental is that, when we talk about development cooperation, we should not forget foreign policy and humanitarian aid.
Just one development cooperation measure, if not in line with humanitarian aid measures and with foreign policy, could undoubtedly produce negative results that we do not want.
The EU should thus have a foreign policy on common security, that will enable dialogue in a field where we can really make substantial impact and a significant economic contribution.
We are still lacking in this, unfortunately.
However, I wish to thank Commissioner Pinheiro for the effort he is making for development and real cooperation, especially bearing in mind the need for the necessary financial means.
<d>
Mr President, about 20 years ago I was talking to an elderly gentleman about the generation gap.
He said to me: 'Of course there is a generation gap.
The only exposure I had as a child to anywhere outside the street where I lived in Cork was when we went down to a neighbour's house and put our ears up to an old steam radio and heard somebody far away singing 'When the red red robbin comes bob bob bobbing along'.
Look at what my grandchildren are seeing now. 'He was, of course, at that stage referring only to the television.
We are extremely happy to totally support Mr Whitehead's excellent report.
As has already been said, it was supported unanimously in committee.
I am also conscious, as somebody who still has not managed to crack this system, of the difficulty for all of us in legislating for such a volatile and dynamic medium.
Parents are rightly concerned.
Unfortunately, just as with the television set, it is not always possible to leave your children alone.
Many voluntary groups concerned about the material which is undoubtedly appearing and, as Carole Tongue has rightly said, is very easily accessible need to go back to some of the most simple rules when, whether you can understand it or not, you try to accompany your children on some of their journeys into cyberspace.
You might not quite understand what is going on, you might have to pretend you understand, but the mere fact that they are aware that you are interested and with them might in itself be a very useful way in which we can deal with this.
All to frequently almost on a daily basis we see evidence that children have become desensitized by some of the material they have been exposed to, both on the Internet and on our television screens.
Often with deeply tragic results.
I wish to join the chorus of praise for Mr Whitehead.
This was a totally unanimous report.
None of us have any problems in supporting the points he made and we hope very much that the effectiveness of voluntary regulation will be demonstrated as soon as we get the first report.
<d>
Madam President, I believe I am the last speaker on behalf of this House in this fascinating debate. It is not the first debate on this subject, nor will it be the last.
It is fascinating thanks to the forward thinking reports by Mr Tindemans, who has occupied himself with this subject for decades.
I was and remain sceptical about the opportunities to develop a genuine defence policy within the Union context.
I am not opposed to it on principle, but consider it sensible to leave NATO on this point for what it is.
What's more, it does not seem sensible to me to put the cart before the proverbial horse.
The discussion on the defence of own territory has been pushed into the background somewhat over the past few years by a much more important discussion on the role of NATO, the European Union and the WEU in crisis management.
I am therefore much more interested in the question of whether the Union will be capable of carrying out the so-called Petersberg tasks should the situation arise.
Then we will be dealing with crisis management elsewhere.
This is therefore the crux, I believe, of a military debate at national level.
The realization of this option, for which the foundations were also laid in Amsterdam, and preparing ourselves for the possibility should be given priority over the coming years.
It also concerns the practical interpretation of the relationship between the European Union and the Western European Union in this sphere.
What the Union needs above all, and I have often said so, is positive practical experience.
With such an experience in the sphere of possible crisis management, common defence might also come into view.
So I would like to turn it all around.
The Union must learn to trust itself regarding security issues.
The introduction of the euro will also without question lead to the necessary dynamism in this area.
Economic union leads to political union; this has been said often enough.
As far as that is concerned I believe that the security experts in this Parliament can expect a sunny future.
The last thing I would like to say has been said frequently before.
The best contribution the European Union can make to security in Europe is its enlargement.
This does not involve any military instrument.
The proof that the scope of the security instruments of the European Union is extensive must, I think, remain the starting point in the debate in this Parliament on the security role of the Union.
<d>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, alongside unemployment, the fear of crime has become a major concern for many people.
In this context, organized crime is increasingly perceived as a problem.
Mind you, there is a widespread but inaccurate assumption that organized crime essentially manifests itself in spectacular serious crimes.
There is an equally widespread misconception that organized crime is essentially committed by organizations which do not share our nationality but come from abroad.
Both these views are wrong!
Organized crime is basically just the systematically organized committing of repeatable criminal offences, even minor ones, to make a profit.
Most people think of drug-dealing in this context.
Drug-dealing should certainly be included, but it is only part of what we are concerned with.
Systematic theft or the systematic counterfeiting of credit cards, for example, should also be included.
I want to illustrate this by means of an example.
If a pocket is picked, for example in Brussels, we may be dealing in some cases with a drug addict acquiring money so that he can buy his drugs.
But we may also be dealing with specialist pickpockets who are flown into the city and spend a whole day there working systematically.
In the evening they are back on the plane, on their way to another continent.
As for the stolen cards, they are flown to somewhere in Asia.
They are used to buy things there and the goods purchased are turned back into money by fence organizations.
That is organized crime.
Organized crime is increasingly involved in the area of credit cards.
The loss is estimated by police authorities at some US $1 billion per year.
That is a lot of money!
The techniques that are used range from misuse - the forging of signatures - through tampering with credit cards, to complete counterfeiting.
This sum of US $1 billion which I have mentioned is initially smuggled back into the criminal money circuit and, after moneylaundering operations, it eventually ends up in apparently respectable businesses.
The British government has now put forward a proposal for joint action to facilitate the work of the police in this area.
The objective of this proposal is to ensure more rapid exchange of information about credit card crime, for example about new modi operandi and such like.
This swift exchange of information would take place not only between police authorities; there would also be better arrangements for the reciprocal exchange of information between the credit card industry and the police.
Both of these initiatives are right.
That is why our committee pronounced itself in favour of this proposal.
But at the same time we also say that it makes little sense to build up a separate information system for every type of offence in the area of organized crime.
It would be more logical - my colleague, Mr Schulz, will go into this in more detail in a moment - to get Europol involved in this matter as soon as possible instead of building up parallel structures.
That would only lead to confusion.
Secondly, what has been proposed is good, but it does not go far enough.
If we are to proceed effectively against credit card crime we need at least two more measures.
On the one hand, we need a standardization of security markings on credit cards.
Most of you may not be aware that every credit card has its own security markings by means of which it is possible to determine whether it is a forgery.
Some of these markings are not visible, sometimes they can be seen under ultra-violet light, and some of them are known only to the initiated.
The problem is that every credit card organization that issues a card uses different markings.
That means that those who accept credit cards in a shop would have to learn 8, 10 or even more different security markings, but no-one does.
What we need is standardization, along the lines of what happens with banknotes, where there are two or three markings which are known to every cashier.
To this end we in the European Union at least need proposals from the Commission; the matter will have to be legally regulated.
There is also a common belief that the credit card industry voluntarily takes all manner of steps to prevent the misuse of credit cards.
The truth is that there is a cost-benefit analysis, not unlike the calculation which you may yourselves make when you consider if it is worthwhile taking out insurance or running the risk of damage, because in the long run it works out cheaper than paying for insurance.
Credit card organizations act in a similar way.
That is why so far we do not have the safest basis that there could be, namely not paying with your signature but following the same procedure as with cash dispensers, whereby there is a chip on these plastic cards and you sign with a sequence of four numbers which only you know, in other words a chip and a PIN.
However, the pre-requisite for such an approach would be the availability in restaurants and shops of machines where the code could be entered.
This has for a long time been possible with the use of the Carte bleue in France but not in other countries.
It was done in France not for reasons of security, but to skim off the market.
But that does not matter, it is the result that is important.
The credit card industry is resisting this approach partly with the argument that a silver shop in India would never raise enough money to buy such a machine.
The industry argues that the introduction of such an approach would hinder the further spread of credit cards.
So the industry is not automatically interested in the highest standard of security.
But society does have an interest.
It must be of major interest to us that organized crime should be fought wherever possible, because ultimately it represents a danger to society.
That is a further reason for legal proposals in this area.
In conclusion, I would repeat that what the British government has suggested is a step in the right direction, but it does not go far enough, and the Commission is required to act in response to our far-reaching demands.
<d>
Commissioner, you recently told the WTO ambassadors - and have confirmed it here today - that there is a lot of unfair competition at international level in the current global economy, and that since it is subject to different jurisdictions, it therefore causes serious problems.
You even said today - and then as well - that the ideal solution would be a global agreement able to solve the problems which arise at national level, by jumping to a different scale.
It would indeed be ideal to create competition structures which include basic principles, such as restricting abusive practices and concentrations, common principles to prohibit unfair competition in the international sphere, and the development of a cooperation instrument based on experience gained in this field.
We think that all sounds very good, Commissioner.
It would be ideal. I think it is a good idea to carry on thinking about it, but it is urgent.
When are we really going to see something practical done about this urgent matter?
<d>
Mr President, to consider the welfare of live animals during their transportation is a commendable objective, and there is nothing worthy in this.
Moreover, you get out of it what you put in.
The field of animal production as a whole has every interest in respecting animals during their transportation, for everyone knows that the market value of an animal is greatly reduced if its transportation conditions are poor.
We therefore agree with this respect for transport conditions, provided, however, that they are applied everywhere, and include trade with third countries, both imports - from the point of departure - and exports, and that they can be implemented and are useful.
By way of example, what is the use of having strict guidelines for the manufacture of new vehicles if the way they are used is not in line with the principles of respect for animal welfare?
We also know that the climate varies substantially between the Mediterranean and the Nordic regions.
Why, then, have the same manufacturing standards?
Finally, farmers themselves also use specific vehicles for transporting their animals, either to take them to market within a very limited radius or simply to take them to grass elsewhere.
In this respect, too, we must be careful not to create useless additional costs for farmers.
Consequently, we are opposed to all amendments aimed at increasing the costs for farmers and for companies in this line of business.
On the other hand, we ask that, within the WTO agreements, international trade as a whole should take account of international transport standards.
<d>
We must point out at the outset the considerable delay in the regulation of the free movement of persons, in contrast to the complete freedom of movement of goods, services and capital.
In this respect, especially, we underline the enormous problems faced by transient workers with regard to safeguarding their social security and labour rights.
Especially acute is the problem of free movement faced by third-country nationals who legally reside within the boundaries of a Member State, during their movement within the boundaries of the European Union.
However, we disagree categorically with any attempt to link the issues relating to the free movement of people with the Schengen Agreement. The basic element of this Treaty is not to facilitate the free movement of people within the European Union, but to hold electronic files on and, by means of networked centres, to carry out surveillance on, millions of citizens, and to gradually transform the European Union into an impregnable fortress for third-country nationals, as is clear from the most recent proposals concerning the rights of entry and residence.
Based on the assumption that transient workers are not second class workers, we call for equality of treatment for them in financial, social and fiscal terms.
In addition, there must be regulation of the gaps that exist in the exercise of the right of residence for all those seeking work and for pensioners who reside permanently in another Member State.
We think that the Council must go ahead and approve the proposals concerning the amendment of the regulation on the coordination of social security systems for transient workers and extend its field of operation to include social security systems for civil servants and third-country nationals who are covered by the social security system of a Member State.
In addition, there must be regulation to ensure equality of treatment for transient workers and the preservation of their rights if they are posted to another state in respect of their supplementary pension rights and career breaks.
We also wish to highlight the problems created by the varying definitions of "incapacity for work 'and the varying assessment of" degree of disability', as well as by the divergences in the systems used to calculate periods of insurance.
Hulthén report (A4-0233 / 98)
<d>
Mr President, I was referred to personally by Mr Florenz.
He is not here at the moment, otherwise I would have been very glad to give him a lesson on how environmental impact assessment works.
It simply is not the case that we wait for the result and then take the decision.
We all know what such an assessment is supposed to look like.
What is contained in the assessment is irrelevant afterwards.
Basically, the exercise is very successful for those who carry out the studies.
Finally, and this point has already been mentioned by Mr Lannoye, the zero options are missing. Let us consider for a moment what would happen if the project were not implemented.
I was also referred to by Mrs Estevan Bola. I do not think that three months are enough to bring about any serious participation by the public.
<d>
I do not know if the Commission is very competent in the matter, but if there is one field in which neither the Commission nor the Council nor governments can impose their will or desires, it is that of exchange rates, since it is by definition the markets which determine the relative value of currencies the one against the other.
So we are ultimately unable to say at the outset whether the euro will be strong or weak compared to the dollar, as nobody in the world today is able to guarantee the stability of exchange rates.
It is simply the markets which make an assessment on the basis of an economic situation. What is a country's budgetary policy?
What is its monetary policy?
What are the wage trends?
Once these data are known, they are compared to those for other countries, the currencies are compared and a relative idea obtained.
That is how markets operate.
The important thing for the Commission is to ensure that the euro is a stable currency which can be used for most of our trading and which will therefore protect us against exchange rate fluctuations and make us less dependent on movements in the dollar.
For the rest, pursuant to Article 109 of the Treaty, the Commission will assume its full responsibilities, especially when it comes to defining Europe's joint positions and its representation on international bodies. In accordance with the Treaty, it will make the necessary recommendations to ensure that the Council can take decisions and to ensure that, during major international negotiations, whether monetary or otherwise, the European Union is represented and able to defend its interests as well and effectively as it would wish.
<d>
Madam President, Commissioner, although it has all been said, not everyone has spoken yet.
So I shall be very brief.
I want to address four points.
One, pig prices for farmers have fallen more sharply than the prices passed on by the trade.
That too needs pointing out.
Two, the Commissioner said nothing about evaluating the results of the recent pig counts.
After all, he must have good figures here since his expert on pigs learnt his trade on my farm.
That is why he is such a capable man - let us say that quite plainly here!
Three, now would be the best opportunity, and here I agree with Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, to implement the directive on nitrates and to look into the excessive stocks of animals in the Community, so that we can bring them back to a normal level and establish a sensible ratio of fodder land to land spread with liquid manure.
This is the best opportunity to do so.
I am doing so, obviously.
We have all been doing so for ages.
Only the Lower Saxons are, of course, very backward here.
And nevertheless one of them has actually become Chancellor of Germany.
That just goes to show the possibilities in our country!
Four, it needs to be checked to what extent the sharp fall in the grain price has had an impact on or stimulated the processing industry.
The farmers are seeking higher value creation.
That is quite clear, and then we shall never be able to resolve this dilemma.
<d>
Mr President, the debates on what has happened since the break-up of Yugoslavia often adopt a rather high tone.
Kosovo is now the most acute problem.
It constitutes a risk to the stability and security of the entire region, and threatens to affect the European Union itself if the disturbances spread to the south.
We therefore need to be as objective as possible, because very often the loudest voices are heard from those who do not themselves face any direct danger.
There is a ten-day extension of the NATO ultimatum and a fragile agreement has been reached which may not be perfect and may be being violated by both sides, but it is a positive first step, as the Presidency too has stressed.
We must give it our backing and demand respect for it.
We are only too aware that fanatics will always react against such agreements and try to sabotage them, but this is all the more reason to persist.
The savage Serbian attacks on civilians are beyond doubt, as are the human rights violations and Belgrade's efforts to muzzle the press.
But there is also no doubt about the intransigence of the so-called Albanian liberation army which is restricting the options of the moderate Rugova.
We must also consider whether the systematic marginalisation of the entire Serbian nation promoted by the west may not simply have lent strength to the fanatics and the nationalists, and whether what the non-nationalist Serbian opposition says about Milosevic might be true, namely that he is fostering the conviction that everyone is against the Serbs and that they have to fight in order to survive.
The European Union must exert every possible diplomatic pressure to back the agreement achieved and demand respect for democratic principles and human rights, together with the reforms mentioned in connection with Kosovo.
Everyone agrees, and the UK Foreign Minister said the same thing again yesterday, that there is no question of independence.
However, NATO military intervention in an independent state outside its jurisdiction and without the agreement of all the permanent members of the Security Council is also no simple matter.
There are other ways of intervening, which the Presidency has spelled out very carefully.
If we hold our line political agreement will be achieved, the people of Kosovo will be settled under the new agreements, and the Serbian people will more easily put the ghosts of the past, which they too find oppressive, behind them.

Having established the single internal market and entered the final straight for the introduction of the euro, the EU is now trying to armour-plate its policy with measures which will 'safeguard' it from the reactions of European citizens and their disputes.
In the name of unimpeded implementation of the principle of the free movement of goods, it is trying to use the proposed regulation to undermine the most fundamental social rights.
The argument always used, the celebrated 'obstacles to trade', is again being trotted out as an excuse to stifle European citizens' democratic, social and personal rights.
Under the first proposal, which represented the prevailing view in the Commission - the predominant 'federal' body of the EU with extensive executive powers - private citizens were given the right, following a decision by the Commission, to go to the national courts and to ask for the adoption of temporary measures, the award of compensation and the imposition of fines.
At the same time, and in order to 'prevent the spread of disturbances', the Member State on whose territory disputes are taking place is transformed into a policing executive body with responsibility for adopting the 'necessary' suppressive measures to 'remove obstacles, failing which it risks the Damoclean sword of being taken before the European Court of Justice.
Working people will be attacked on two fronts: by the national authorities and by 'private individuals who would be affected'.
The political agreement achieved by the Council brought some improvement to the initial text since the individual's right of recourse to legal proceedings is eliminated in favour of a decision by the Commission and recourse to insurance.
However, the legal and political pressures on the Member State involved remain in place.
Despite the changes made, the proposed regulation we are considering potentially unleashes a storm and threatens to become a decisive blow against the exercise of collective labour rights.
The right to strike and the right to hold meetings are flagrantly undermined and a new period of restrictive application of those rights is being officially inaugurated.
It is clear that the Europe of monopolies and bankers cannot withstand the claims of Greek, French and Italian farmers who are fighting to mitigate the consequences of the anti-agricultural policies pursued by the EU and the Member States, with demonstrations by lorry-drivers demanding reasonable working hours and the abolition of dumping.
The Europe of 'free movement' cannot withstand action by ships' crews fighting to prevent their labour rights from being reduced to third-world levels.
Yet again, hypocrisy is exceeding all bounds.
On the one hand, lip-service is paid to the celebrated subsidiarity, bombastic declarations are made, the fundamental rights of individuals are invoked, and at the same time the Member States are transformed into brutal suppressors of the struggles of the labour movement.
Clearly, the division of responsibilities that results from subsidiarity assigns the role of strike-breaker to the Member States.
There is also justified concern about the part to be played by the Schengen Information System in this context, since there is a danger that anyone actively involved in industrial action will be entered on lists of those 'suspected' of being responsible for public disorder.
The step to bring back the concept of 'the enemy within' is not far off and is facilitated by the deliberately vague definition of 'the suppression of terrorism', which seems to have been upgraded to one of Europol's main areas of activity.
We will vote against the report in the most categorical way.
It is an issue where there is no room for amendments or corrections.
But on that point, it is not by chance that some amendments by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, which attempt to introduce some kind of safety valve in relation to the right to hold meetings and concern for legitimacy, from a legal point of view and exclusively in the context of national labour legislation, have not been included in the report.
For our part, we call upon working people in Europe to continue their struggle to overthrow such orders and fight to safeguard and extend their rights.
We will stand by them.

Mr President, when I received the Court of Auditors' annual report yesterday, I read it with great interest.
As a Dane, I was naturally interested in what it had to say about Denmark.
I have read the report countless times overnight, but I cannot find anything about Denmark in it.
Of course, I am glad that we are doing things properly in our country.
It is always good to be able to take that as a starting-point.
I noted that there have been a number of special reports, and I would like to say that one of them which really made an impression on me is the one which has featured in the press for the last fortnight and deals with safety in nuclear power plants.
I would like to ask Mr Friedmann, and also Mr Liikanen and the Commission, not just to focus on nuclear power plants in the eastern countries.
We should perhaps also be looking at the situation in Murmansk, where there are several hundred submarines which have been scrapped but still have active reactors, and where a number of reactors have been dumped in the Barents Sea.
I really do think that we need to have a special report on this area, and I think that instead of going on talking about these things and employing expensive consultants and a good deal more besides, we should employ people ourselves and send them out there to start the necessary process.
That naturally requires there to be cooperation with the Member States.
I know that is difficult, but we must do something about this.
The greatest time bomb that we have is the nuclear power plants and the submarines which are lying around.
All the other small-scale fraud which is happening round about should also be addressed, but it must not be our top priority.

The review of the CAP in 1992 led to a large reduction of the Community budget amounts available for agriculture and to the annihilation of small and medium-sized family holdings, mainly in southern parts of the Community.
As a result, the numbers of holdings and people employed have been greatly reduced, the proportion of unemployment in rural areas has rocketed, and the rate at which the countryside is being deserted has increased to dangerous levels.
The new proposals put forward on European farming by the Commission in Agenda 2000 are perhaps the most representative indication of the EU's overall intentions as regards its model of development.
The agricultural sector bears the brunt of the changes dictated by the medium-term strategic plans of monopolistic capital, since it is one of the most critical sectors for the shaping of the new economic landscape and the distribution of world markets.
The questionable argument in favour of continual cuts in the section of the Community budget devoted to agriculture, which the Agenda 2000 proposals and those for the review of the CAP put forward, is actually - and now quite openly - calling into question and undermining the decisive developmental role which agriculture has played up to now in most parts of Europe.
The EU is continually eroding its existing agricultural potential since its declared aim, besides saving resources, is both to prepare for the predatory enterprise of enlargement towards the central and eastern European countries and to secure further possibilities for responding - with customary subservience to the USA's demands - to the new established order of the World Trade Organisation from 2000 onwards.
We have in our hands proposals which are contradictory, dangerous, without any balance between the human factor, production and land, proposals which aim to reduce the agricultural population still further, cut prices and production costs for the sake of competition, and in general replace intervention by help to accumulate private stores.
Those proposals will not only cause imbalances in production but will also constitute a direct threat to product quality, environmental equilibrium, farm employment and social balance and cohesion.
Furthermore, this proposal heralds flagrant and impermissible intervention in the budgets of Member States by introducing conditions of subservience with the compulsory co-financing of direct aid by the Member States.
This not only goes against the provisions of the Treaty, but indirectly paves the way for a substantive transfer of commitment expenditures to the budgets of the Member States - without the consent of the national parliaments - for policies and decisions laid down by the EU.
In the name of an unreasonable rationalisation which runs contrary to any concept of solidarity, renationalisation is being advocated with excessive hypocrisy and demagogy, though it will only relate to expenditure, while the Community will continue to have the exclusive right to determine every detail of the CAP - quotas, price and export subsidies, duties etc. without leaving any scope for flexibility or for the Member State itself to define its own agricultural policy.
In other words, 'heads we win, tails you lose'!
We categorically oppose this Commission proposal and there is no margin whatsoever for its' better management ', as some people are saying in order to make it look better and more' digestible '.
It is our duty, both to the farmers and for the sake of social equilibrium, to prevent the evils prescribed by the proposal.
We must resist and avert a policy which is opposed not only by farmers in the EU but by all working people who will bear the brunt of this anti-agricultural EU policy which aims to use the budget resources of the Member States, and this in the context of a policy of financial discipline and strict austerity.
Parliament's view is that it is extremely important for the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy to be harmonised with the interests and wishes of the large majority of the population, who are now certain to escalate their efforts to frustrate and avert this policy.
<d>
Mr President, the rapporteur is right to highlight in his report the importance of information and communication in the context of introducing the euro.
It was the European Parliament that, very early on, pointed out the lack of information on the euro and fortunately found in the European Commission a partner to organise cooperation between the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Member States of the Union.
As always, I regret that information in the Member States and also in the regions and local communities is not as highly developed as it should be.
We have discovered that many people in the European Union do not feel involved.
They feel that they are not properly informed and that the information they have is not broad enough.
They do not feel that they are sufficiently well informed about the pros and cons of monetary union.
Yet monetary union begins in only 17 days.
We in the European Parliament must therefore ensure that this work on information continues, as the rapporteur rightly emphasised.
It must continue in particular in the next year when we will be living in the European monetary union but only cashless payments will be handled in euros.
Do you know that many people believe that euro coins and notes will be available to them from 4 January?
Do you know how frustrating this will be?
Do you know how difficult it is to adjust to a different currency?
All these issues concern us particularly as Members of this European Parliament.
We must therefore continue to insist on conferences on the subject of the euro, on discussions and on reliable information booklets.
But we must also ensure that we include the NGOs, consumer protection associations, youth organisations and women's associations, so that they can help to persuade people in these areas.
I believe that with the help of such efforts over and above the report, a great deal more can be done and that the genuinely positive approaches of the information and communication work on the euro can and must therefore be extended.
It is true that we must also consider the problem groups in our society, the disadvantaged sections of the information society, and it would therefore be helpful if the Commission could tell Parliament today that it intends to make 10% of the resources available for these disadvantaged groups and that in addition to the initial projects it has a new strategy to genuinely include everyone.
We have also shown that we are concerned not only about handicapped persons but also about people who live in remoter regions, who do not have much opportunity to travel, and also about illiterate people, for example.
We therefore need a more substantial contribution and also a greater commitment from the Member States.
So I call on the Ministers of Finance and in particular the Ministers of Education in the European Union to ensure that the euro is taught about in schools and in adult education, and to provide the necessary resources for this.
We must involve young people and older people, so that they know that European monetary union is in their interest.
We cannot leave it to the private sector to take full responsibility for information on the euro.
The public sector must take on the leading role which we wanted it to have in the regions and in the Member States too.
<d>
Mr President, Mr Habsburg-Lothringen, on your question about the legal situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, I have to say that unfortunately not everything was done that should have been done.
That is why, in particular at the Peace Implementation Conference, the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Schüssel, criticised the poor cooperation by the Bosnian authorities on this question as well as on the question of the return of refugees.
He said that the return home of Bosnian citizens, especially of course those from minority groups, is still being hampered by a lack of willingness to cooperate at all administrative levels and in particular by the generally poor security situation.
He also expressed disappointment at the lack of progress in this area and hoped to see substantial improvements in 1999.
We must manage to ensure that a critical mass of minority-group refugees return, so that this becomes an irreversible process.
That is the heart of the matter.
On the question of Croatia and the PHARE programme, let me tell you that Croatia must fulfil the conditions laid down under the regional concept if it is to be fully eligible for the PHARE programme and if it is to be included in the negotiations on a trade and cooperation agreement as a preliminary step towards a Europe agreement.
As I am sure you are aware, as early as April 1997 the Council adopted an overall strategy, what is known as the regional concept, for relations with the western Balkans, namely Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania.
In an endeavour to consolidate peace and stability in the region, to contribute to its reconstruction and in particular to support its European aspirations, it was decided that the EU would progressively build up its relations with these countries too.
To that end, as you will know, the European Union laid down political and economic conditions that must be fulfilled with a view to the attainment firstly of autonomous trade preferences, then of membership of PHARE, and finally of treaty relations.
The Council is monitoring the progress on fulfilment of these conditions on a regular basis, and adopted its most recent conclusions on the subject on 9 November.

Mr President, creative and innovative activities will be critical to the development of the information society.
This proposal for a directive is an important part of the legislative framework which is currently being drawn up at both a European and a global level to guarantee harmonious development of the information society.
The information society is in fact evolving in a global context.
In 1996, the international community adopted two treaties under the auspices of WIPO: one on copyright, and the other on interpretation and performance and on phonograms.
I would remind the House that the European Union played a vital role in the drafting of those treaties.
It can now accede to them as the European Community and be among the first to ratify them.
The United States has already met its requirements.
Thirty instruments of ratification will have to be deposited before the treaties enter into force.
The European Union accounts for 42 because of the agreements that link it to the countries of the European Economic Area and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, and the fact that it has association agreements with still more countries.
Ratification of the treaties by the Union and its Member States is based on their incorporation into the national legal systems; it is their incorporation into Community law that is, among other things, the objective of this proposal.
Alongside meeting our international commitments, the basic aim of the proposal is to put in place a harmonised legislative framework for copyright and related rights.
We expect that greater legal certainty, guaranteeing investment in creative and innovative activity and in the network infrastructures, will boost growth and the competitiveness of the European industry and job creation.
It is for us to tap this huge cultural and economic potential by providing the appropriate legislative framework.
In drafting and adopting this proposal - which, as you will remember, is the product of wide-ranging consultation dating back to 1994 - the Commission has taken the greatest care to retain a fair balance between the various rights and interests at issue, which are frequently in open conflict.
I am well aware that this was also the aim of Parliament's work.
On behalf of the Commission, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Barzanti, for having done his job so efficiently.
He has managed to combine a thorough understanding of the problem, founded also on the earlier work on the 1995 Green Paper and the 1996 communication, with the great resolve that tackling such sensitive proposals demands.
Fifty-eight amendments have been tabled, 30 of which relate to the operative part of the text and 28 to the recitals: of those 58 amendments, the Commission is able to accept 28 and to take into consideration 14, but it has to reject 16.
The amendments the Commission is able to accept are the following: Amendments Nos 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 17, 18, 20, 21, 24, 29, 31, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 55 and 57.
The Commission will take into account the following amendments, albeit with a number of mainly drafting changes: Amendments Nos 9, 11, 16, 22, 33, 39, 46, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 58 and the new Amendments Nos 82 and 91.
As far as the recitals are concerned, the Commission rejects Amendment No 3 which, in our view, confuses protected work and information in general and is contrary to the principles of the acquis communautaire; the first part of Amendment No 13 which is incompatible with the WIPO treaty, though we accept the second part;
Amendment No 14 which does not, in our view, succeed in defining the concept of 'public', a responsibility we believe is best left to the Member States, which are in a better position to define this somewhat elastic term;
Amendment No 19 which does not correspond to the amendments tabled in relation to Article 5 (2) (b);
Amendment No 23 because it calls into question the approach taken in the proposal to the exceptions; Amendments Nos 27 and 28 which are already covered by the third recital; and Amendments Nos 15, 25 and 26 because they are too far outside the scope of the proposal.
Turning then to the actual articles of the directive, the Commission rejects Amendment No 30 because the issue it tackles is taken into account in Article 5 (1);
Amendments Nos 32 and 48 which are designed to introduce new exceptions for the benefit of broadcasters - I wish to deal separately, in just a moment, with our rejection of Amendment No 56 concerning Article 5 (1) - Amendment No 40 because the concern on which it is based is amply taken into account by Article 5 (3) (c), an amendment at your suggestion; and Amendment No 47 because that issue is being dealt with under the 27th recital, amended by Amendment No 20.
As regards the amendments tabled at this part-session, given that they either reflect viewpoints and concerns already taken into account in the report of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights or are amendments rejected by that committee, the Commission endorses the report.
Of the new amendments, we are able to take into account only Nos 82 and 91 which relate to mediation, a point mentioned by Mr Perry and taken up by Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi.
Overall, the Commission is thus able to take Parliament's line on many points.
I repeat: we are rejecting 16 amendments, taking account of 14 and accepting 28.
To conclude, I have two points to make concerning two specific issues.
As far as the broadcasters are concerned, the House is proposing to add three new exceptions for their benefit.
I would remind you of our interest in observing a balance between the rights and interests which are at stake.
The Commission accepts Amendment No 39, which introduces an exception for broadcasters in respect of specific acts of reproduction necessary to facilitate a legitimate broadcasting act, because it meets a genuine technological need.
In contrast, and in an effort to achieve a balance between the interests in play, the Commission feels compelled to reject Amendments Nos 32 and 48, the first of which introduces an exception that would allow broadcasters to make available, on request, programmes largely consisting of phonograms.
We then come to Article 5 (1) - the source of such controversy.
What is the purpose of that provision?
It is designed to establish an exception to the right of reproduction in regard to some technical acts of reproduction that are an integral part of a technological process, carried out for the sole purpose of enabling a different use to be made of the protected material.
This is the only mandatory exception in the whole of the proposal and it is therefore very clearly drafted.
That provision will give the telecommunications operators and service providers the legal certainty they need to be able to perform operations for the benefit of the network services, which are very often transnational in nature.
We have subdivided your proposals on this and are able to take account of some.
As far as the definition of the scope of the exceptions is concerned, we are able to accept the inclusion of the words' transient 'and' incidental ', as providing a closer definition of the concept of' temporary 'that appears in our proposal, and of the word' essential 'which further defines the incidental nature of the act in relation to the technical transmission process.
Consequently, we reject Amendments Nos 65 and 88, which have the effect of watering down the latter condition.
We cannot, however, accept the concept of 'economic significance' for the rightholder.
The reference to our concept of 'independent economic significance' is consistent with the aim of the exception and therefore workable when the exception is actually applied.
It is in any event worth bearing in mind that protection against unjustified economic harm is provided for in Article 5 (4).
Finally, we cannot accept the insertion of the clause referring to 'uses... authorised... or permitted by law', the addition of which would mean that the exception would be triggered only in relation to items whose use had been authorised by the rightholders or permitted by law.
We are aware of the concerns of rightholders who fear that the network will end up acting as a broadcasting vehicle for items that have been illegally copied - pirated items - but if we are to hit our target, we have to consider beforehand what is the most workable and balanced way of achieving it.
In this case, that way has to be sought by ensuring a proper balance between rights and exceptions to those rights.
Finally, I would draw your attention to a very important group of amendments: those concerning private copies.
Your amendments uphold two important principles: the right of rightholders to fair remuneration and the fine distinction concerning private digital copies.
The first principle protects a need for equity; it is a measured step forwards in the quest for legal certainty in this sector.
The Commission's acceptance of the amendment relating to digital copies for private use must be seen in the context of the approach already set out in recitals 26 and 27 of our proposal.
Specifically in the light of what is set out in those sections of the proposal, the Commission agrees to recognise the principle that, in the digital sphere, the possibility of making a copy for private use must exist, without prejudice to the effective and workable technical means that are capable of protecting the interests of rightholders.
We therefore align ourselves with the solution you have put forward, though the amendment will have to be redrafted in such a way as to provide an accurate statement of the principle.
You link not only analogue and digital copies for private use but also the exceptions concerning illustration and teaching to the principle of fair remuneration for rightholders.
That is a formula which allows broader harmonisation and respects the traditions and practices of the Member States.
The Commission is able to follow Parliament's line here too, and therefore accepts Amendments Nos 36 and 37 as well as Amendments No 35 and 41.
The protection of technological measures forms the subject-matter of Article 6 of the proposal, which has been substantially recast by your Amendments Nos 49, 50, 51, 52, 53 and 54.
We are able to take those amendments into consideration, subject to a degree of clarification which the Commission considers important.
We congratulate Mr Barzanti on a comprehensive and determined piece of work. I welcome the fact that you support the Commission proposal, in terms of both the overall approach and - I think I can honestly say this - the main components.
In the past, Parliament's influence has been decisive in the adoption of the five directives already in force; the cooperation that exists between Parliament and the Commission in the field of copyright and related rights is something we can rely on, and for that I am truly grateful.

It was widely predicted. Armed conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea has broken out again with unprecedented violence.
Although the information reaching us is very patchy, it is clear that there have already been thousands of victims, military and civilian, and the conflict, which apparently flared up after a small border problem, is threatening to become one of the bloodiest wars in the history of Africa.
In this Parliament we have always been concerned about relations and tensions between Ethiopia and Eritrea, and Parliament's Committee on Development and Cooperation succeeded in getting the ambassadors from both countries to attend several meetings it organised - something which no-one else has managed to do.
Today we call on the governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea to cease hostilities immediately.
We also call for absolute compliance with the moratorium on air raids, which has already been violated, unfortunately.
The leaders of the two countries of the Horn of Africa now have the historic responsibility of choosing between peace and even worse crimes against their peoples.
The OAU proposal for an agreement between the two countries must be accepted by both parties without further delay, before the situation on the ground renders it obsolete.
All arms supplies and military assistance to the two warring sides must immediately cease, as called for yesterday by the United Nations Security Council.
The European Union must join the Organisation for African Unity in applying intense pressure and offering political and diplomatic mediation, which has been totally inadequate in the last few months.
The United States of America might have been expected to take on the task over the last few months, but it has proved quite incapable of doing so.
So we call on the Council to take a clear and strong political initiative along these lines, and on the Commission to ensure that the thousands of refugees and victims of the conflict receive the maximum humanitarian assistance wherever possible.

In the 21st century, good quality water will perhaps be of greater strategic importance than oil, which is a good reason for thanking Mr White for the efforts he is making now to ensure that we have good quality surface water by 2010.
The river basin approach enables the Member States to pursue policies which are specifically tailored to river basins, which we think is an excellent idea.
If the best use is made of local knowledge, such as the water boards can provide, it will help to achieve better results.
Involving those who are directly concerned makes it much more likely that new policies will be accepted.
Establishing a new framework directive is certainly going to take some doing: the way it was dealt with at first reading was extremely confusing.
Our examination of the draft framework directive was postponed several times, mainly because of the 'premature position' that the Council adopted last June.
All in all, it was a strange state of affairs.
After that, with the Amsterdam Treaty in mind, progress started to be made towards reaching a political agreement, though this has only been successful in a small number of areas because certain Member States refuse to be flexible.
This is a pity, because it is often much easier to reach agreement at an early stage before opinions become too firmly entrenched.
The compromise amendments which I and others have tabled are a rather disappointing result after a very promising start.
Amendments Nos 189 to 193 on the wetlands are designed to maintain a buffer water capacity which is essential in order to prevent floods and drought.
Compromise Amendments Nos 194 and 195 take account of the fact that the protection of marine waters is already covered by international agreements.
We are in favour of organising occasional conferences on water policy, which all parties concerned, including NGOs, should be able to attend, as proposed in Amendment No 198.
The re-injection of water for certain necessary activities must still be possible, provided that it is done in a responsible manner, and Amendment No 201 creates adequate safeguards here.
With the emission limit values, all the various sources must be considered, not just the major polluters.
The difficulty here is in enforcing the polluter pays principle, and we therefore wonder whether Amendments Nos 65, 67 and 68 can really be implemented in practice.

Mr President, the struggle for equality between men and women has seen some significant successes but has also suffered some bitter setbacks.
The 1995 Kalanke ruling, which found in favour of a man who believed he had been discriminated against because an equally qualified female colleague was given preference over him, belongs in the second category.
The ruling stated that, given identical qualifications, it was an infringement of Community law for female candidates automatically to be given preference.
The Commission amended its directive and argued that a rigid quota system that did not take account of individual circumstances was unlawful, while positive action - for instance flexible quotas - was lawful.
Our Committee on Women's Rights regarded the proposal as a whole as not very useful and warned against any watering down of the directive.
While the Kalanke ruling was a setback, the European Court of Justice's decision in the 1997 Marschall judgment was encouraging.
Laws that give priority to women but also allow individual cases to be assessed and do not exclude men from the outset are absolutely consistent with Community law.
Accordingly, positive action measures must be taken to remove the still considerable inequalities on the labour market and in regard to promotion.
At the time the Commission was waiting for the Court of Justice's judgment and for the negotiations in the run-up to the Amsterdam Treaty.
So it would be consistent for you, Commissioner, to take a similar approach today.
Articles 2 and 3 of the Amsterdam Treaty stipulate that equality between men and women is a task and an aim.
All active policies will pursue that aim in future.
So I would ask you to accept the plea by Astrid Lulling, our as ever pugnacious rapporteur, which the European People's Party will of course approve again.
Withdraw your proposal to amend the directive; it dates from the time after the Kalanke and before the Marschall ruling, so it is certainly old enough!.
A new proposal must respect the evaluation of equal opportunities as a Community task, as it must the specific advantages allowed in Article 119 for the under-represented sex in the Member States of the European Union.
<d>
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the speech made yesterday in Berlin by the Commission President designate seemed to confirm that there is no intention of changing the neo-liberal course set for building Europe.
It is a fact that the Berlin Council accepted the constraints imposed by the Stability Pact and did not alter them, and that the resources it approved were an inadequate response to Community policies and to the challenges of cohesion and of future enlargement.
The Berlin Council maintained unacceptable exceptions to the own resources system, yet at the same time failed to agree on any penalty for speculative movements of capital.
The rejection of agricultural cofinancing cannot blind us to the fact that imbalances and privileges for richer and more powerful countries have been preserved in the CAP.
As for regional policy, the overall reduction in the Cohesion Fund will mean a cut of at least 18 billion escudos per annum for Portugal, which is incidentally one of the cohesion countries.
And if this reduction leads to more restrictive conditions, structural resources could be even more limited.
In contrast to the pompous declarations and triumphs announced in Berlin concerning internal consumption, the lack of solidarity and the indifference towards cohesion confirmed in Berlin will lead to greater stagnation, higher unemployment, and poorer jobs and social welfare in the European Union.
<d>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in examining the report by our colleague Mr Brinkhorst on the postponement of discharge for the 1997 financial year, we are not aiming to dwell on the serious grievances that have swamped the Commission in recent years and forced it to resign.
We are now at the end of a very eventful and stormy period during which the Commission tarnished its image and lost its credibility.
And yet we must continue, and to continue means to look to the future and take stock of the task in hand so that where there has been defeat, failure and negativity, tomorrow there will be success, transparency and confidence.
Contrary to what the Council has done lightly and thoughtlessly, we will not grant discharge to the Commission today since, as Laurens Jan Brinkhorst so well explained, discharge will not be granted to a resigning Commission that can no longer advise the European Parliament on future guidelines.
Postponement is therefore the most appropriate solution technically speaking and in political terms it constitutes something of a peace gesture towards the new Commission. However, it does not dismiss the need for us to remain as vigilant as possible or the need to act with a certain resolve.
The future message we should like to give to the new Commission involves what we no longer want at any cost and what we do want at all costs. We no longer want a weak Commission that is non-existent politically speaking and that is incapable of controlling and managing its administration.
We do not want a Commission where the Commissioners are transformed into shepherds that follow their flocks. We do not want a Commission where some officials, who perhaps head an agency with a particular status, turn out to be true petty tyrants of the organisation, imposing their wishes and desires on their Commissioner, who then admits his ignorance of and lack of interest in the issue even when it concerns an amendment to the Community budget adopted by the European Parliament whose implementation does not present any budgetary difficulties or problems relating to the legal basis.
We had the misfortune to experience such a Commission and it is precisely what we do not want to see repeated.
I have reread President Santer's speech and I remember that during his investiture in January 1995 he committed himself, in front of this very House, to a genuine culture of financial management.
In the light of recent events, it is all too easy to see the irony in that today.
It is clear that nothing has been done.
The Commission's only reaction has been to take several subsequent measures aimed at filling in the gaps and appeasing Parliament, but nothing has been drawn up or thought out and no ideas have been formed.
There have been no reforms; the Commission has simply limited itself to promises, preferring rhetoric over action.
The truth is that the Commission was able to identify the problem of the financial mismanagement of European Union policies, but it was unable to come up with any solutions that it could turn into specific actions.
The example of SEM 2000 and the installation of the new ROLEX system to manage all external contracts are good examples of this.
Another example of inefficiency, this time in the area of Community transport, is the computerisation of transit procedures which has met with many delays.
A final example is that of the technical assistance offices which, as everyone knows, have caused many problems in recent years.
However, in spite of the European Parliament's insistence, the Commission still appears to be continuing to entrust the TAOs with the preparation of invitations to tender and the lists of projects to be retained.
The Commission is not to decide on the projects to be retained, but is to ratify the list drawn up by the private consultants, which, in my view, is unacceptable.
So, in short, this is what we do not wish to see repeated.
On the other hand, we do want a Commission that takes full responsibility for its actions and choices, that is transparent in its institutional dialogue and that takes on the role of monitoring the operational policies that the services are responsible for implementing.
Since the Court of Auditors has been drawing up the Statement of Assurance concerning activities financed from the general budget of the European Union, the statement has been negative.
However, we hope that a new Commission that is politically consistent and responsible will enable the Court of Auditors to finally draw up a positive Statement of Assurance for the first time.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as everyone knows, we must not be too quick to criticise those who are coming to our aid.
Let us hope that the new Commission will be able to learn from recent events so that it can successfully complete its mandate and so that today's failure opens the way to tomorrow's success.
We are eagerly awaiting Mr Romano Prodi's arrival in the hope that something good will come of something bad.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we hope that the participants at the Tampere Summit will remember that migratory movements, however relentless, form the basis of the history of humanity and are, in the long-term, the premise for its collective salvation.
We also hope that, on this basis, in trying to create a common area of freedom, security and justice, they are inspired by the principles of solidarity and inclusion and are not thinking about creating a European Community that is peaceful and wealthy on the inside but which is impenetrable to those pushing to get in from the outside on account of hunger, war or social difficulties.
Internal peace and well-being cannot last long because the nearby countries cannot resign themselves to living with insecurity, need and chaos for long.
We would be terrible hypocrites to take up the fight against discrimination, racism, and xenophobia as a founding principle of the European Community and then, in our normal procedure, to implement exclusion policies which heighten the fears of European citizens of being contaminated by people who are different to us.
Just how they are different is a consideration we willingly leave to the racists.
We would also like the area of freedom, security and justice to aim to increase the guarantees for everyone - be they citizens of the Union or people from other countries - and that it does not stop at declaring formal guarantees but also aims to put substantial guarantees into practice, such as those concerning work, social security, personal freedom, equality between men and women and many others which nowadays are being sacrificed on the altar of competition - global competition - so close to the heart of the Commission and its President.
This neoliberalist strategy, a typical exclusion strategy, makes us sceptical even of the Tampere Summit, and we would be naïve to hope that our scepticism will be proved groundless.

Mr President, the chairman of the Group of the European People 's Party expressed his sympathy with regard to my own group, because at the time we made heavy weather of the decision on Customs Union.
I would like to return this sympathy on the grounds of the ease, with which the Group of the European People 's Party has undergone a complete U-turn in its position since the agreement on Customs Union.
Mr President, I have listened attentively to what the President of the Council and also Commissioner Verheugen have said on the subject of the possible candidacy of Turkey in Helsinki.
I would have welcomed it if it really had been an honourable position of the European Union with regard to Turkey.
But I am afraid that we are re-establishing a policy which, for decades, has permitted us to hide behind the Greeks and say that the Greeks would never agree to it.
Now, as the Greeks are showing that they would agree under certain circumstances, we must, in fact, come clean.
We must really ask ourselves in all conscience if we want to have Turkey in the European Union or not.
Nuances of wording, whether it concerns one candidate for one candidacy, as in this case, or whether we should establish a new category of candidates, who are indeed valid candidates but with whom no negotiations are held, will by no means be beneficial to our relationship with Turkey.
My last remark concerns a matter in which nuances of wording once again play a role.
We are always talking about the Kurdish question, but we never talk about the Kurdish people.
This is a people of between 12 and 20 million individuals, who nowhere, either in Turkey or in other countries, can enjoy their freedoms, human rights and rights as citizens.
We must support the cause of these people.

Mr President, Commissioner, the guidelines rightly stress employability, i.e. the possibility for job seekers to actually do the job they are applying for.
But we must never forget that this is just a possibility.
Between this possibility and the reality of the job itself everything will depend on the state of job vacancies in society.
On this subject, the guidelines speak of enterprise spirit.
They are right but, in order to flourish, the entrepreneur needs favourable policy, low interest rates, a competitive euro and, above all, he needs to know the relationship between a given business activity and the number of job offers.
This is the fundamental problem of the relationship between employment levels and growth.
You acknowledge that with growth at less than 2.4% there was no reduction in employment.
France is currently refuting this diagnosis thanks to its policy of reducing working hours, which is still too cautious.
Let us hope that this policy is intensified and that it is extended in a coordinated fashion to Europe as a whole.
Finally, there is one form of enterprise which is particular good at creating jobs; i.e. cooperatives, associations, the third sector.
This sector merits a special status, particularly as regards taxation, and this is the subject of the amendments which we are putting to you.

Madam President, the new proposal for a regulation on the common organisation of the markets in the fisheries and aquaculture sector puts forward new and interesting aspects that need to be thoroughly considered, which I cannot, unfortunately, discuss in this forum.
Being the representative of the largest island in the Mediterranean - Sicily - and head of the province of Catania, where large numbers of people work in the fishing industry, I would have been in a good position to talk about day-to-day experiences.
Today though, I would like to make some constructive criticisms, which I hope can contribute to improving the proposal for a regulation in question.
As far as consumer information is concerned, I fully agree with the Commission when it proposes compulsory labelling indicating the designation of the species, the production method as well as the catch area.
Nevertheless, with the aim of making consumers more responsible and making the market more transparent, other details should be included, for example, the minimum legal size, which would allow fishery resources to be respected.
As far as producers' organisations are concerned, it is true that we need to make them more responsible, as regards both the organisation of the market and the efficient management of resources; however, it would be appropriate - and in this respect I stress the relevance of Amendment No 67, tabled by my political group - for the Member States to be able to grant additional aid to producers' organisations that develop measures which valorise the species caught and measures to adapt supply to demand through structural actions of the FIFG.
In view of the fact that - and it has been reaffirmed here this morning - according to data provided by the Commission, 60% of fishery products consumed in the European Union are imported, we should support aquaculture, which constitutes a major economic opportunity for maritime communities, in a substantial and comprehensive manner.
Often, people do not enter this sector due to a lack of knowledge.
Finally, I would like to conclude by thanking Mrs Fraga Estévez for upholding the amendments tabled by the UEN Group in the Committee on Fisheries.
