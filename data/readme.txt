Please note that whatever data set you use, you need to add the BOS and EOS tokens (represented by <s> and </s>) to the source and target sentences yourself.

Also you may need to unkify (replace by <unk>) the tokens in dev and test sets which do not exist in the training set yourself.

The training sets for Europarl and NC-2016 can be downloaded from:
